<para> 
This filter keeps or removes waypoints based on their proximity to an arc, 
which is a series of connected line segments similar to a route or a track 
but without any associated data other than the coordinates.
</para>

<para> 
The arc is defined in a file whose name must be provided with the 
<option>file</option>.  That file contains pairs of coordinates for the 
vertices of the arc, one coordinate pair per line.  Comments may be
included by preceding them with a '#' character.  An arc file looks 
something like this sample:

<para> 
An arc file may optionally contain gaps in the arc.  You may specify 
such a gap by inserting a line containing "#break" either on a line by 
itself or after the coordinates of the starting point of the new arc segment.

<para>
Assuming the arc above is in a file called 
<filename moreinfo="none">lima_rd.txt</filename>, the following command line
would include only points within one mile of the section of Lima Road 
covered by the arc.
