tack "&amp;output=js" onto the end of a <ulink url="http://maps.google.com>Google Maps">Google Maps</ulink> route URL (use
the "link to this page" option to get a usable URL.)  This allows you
to plan a route using Google Maps, then download it and use it in your
own mapping program or GPS receiver.   To get a file suitable for use
with GPSBabel, plan your route as usual with Google Maps.  Once you've 
got it the way you want it, click the "Link to this page" link in the
upper right-hand corner of the Google Maps page.  Then, edit the URL 
that appears in your address bar by adding "&amp;output=js" (without
the quotes) onto the end.  Hit enter, and the resulting page will be
mostly empty.  It doesn't look like much, but it contains exactly what 
GPSBabel needs.  Save it to disk using whatever menu option your web 
browser provides.

Note that if you are using Microsoft Internet Explorer, you should make sure
to save the web page as "Web Page, HTML Only".  If you save it as "Web Page,
Complete", it will be reformatted into a non-XHTML format that GPSBabel 
cannot read.
