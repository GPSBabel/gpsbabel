<para>While the DG-100 has a button to record waypoints, they seem to be indistinguishable from trackpoints. Therefore, all points will be presented as trackpoints, disregarding whether they were recorded automatically or manually.</para>

The DG-100 provides a physical USB interface to the host computer, but
internally it uses a Prolific PL-2303 chip to do this.  So you must have
drivers installed on your computer to recognize the PL-2303 and provide
that data as a serial port to software like GPSBabel.   Such software
comes with the unit for Windows.  Prolific provides software for Mac OS/X,
but unfortunately their driver has a defect which makes it unusable with
GPSBabel.
