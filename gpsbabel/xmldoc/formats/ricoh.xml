<para>This is the format for the Ricoh 500SE GPS logging camera.
</para>
<para>
 This camera creates log files on the SD card in a folder name "GPSLOG" that 
  are named "YYMMDDN.LOG" wher NN increments from 00 through 99.  The camera 
  appends new tracks into the current file, hence the "new track" field. When 
  the current file reaches about 500K, NN increments and logging continues into 
  the next file. Therefore, there may be multiple tracks in each log 
  file, and tracks may span one or more files. 
</para>
<para>
  GPSBabel will recognize the "new track" field and will generate a new track,
  so if you specify multiple files in the correct order, your tracks will be
  automatically split sensibly.
