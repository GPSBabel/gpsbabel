# Write the same file multiple times...File should always be identical.
# This exercises two bugs discovered on 2013-06-02 in the QXmlWriter code.
# 1) ostring wasn't cleared, so writing two KML files would accumulate them.
# 2) There is, IMO, a bug when reinitializing the QXmlWriter that results
#    in a blank line at the beginning of the output, which makes Google Earth
#    grumpy.  This totally tanks the realtime tracking mode which relies on 
#    this heavily.
