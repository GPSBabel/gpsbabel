<tr><td colspan="2"><p class="gpsbabeldescshort">The cache is not at the coordinates above.   These coords will get you to the correct park and within 1/2 mile of the cache.  The cache is within 35 feet of the trail.   It is not handicapped accessible.   It is a nice walk in the woods that is practical for all ages.  There is no space in the container for trading items.   You should bring a writing stick and bug spray is recommended.</p>
<p class="gpsbabeldesclong">So if the cache isn't at the above coordinates, where is it?  

<ul>

<li>Too bad I hid a boot
<li>Too hot to hoot
<li>Never odd or even
<li>Do geese see God?
<li>"Do nine men interpret?" "Nine men," I nod
<li>Rats live on no evil star
<li>Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog
</ul>

Now that it's intuitively obvious to even the most casual observer where the cache is, turn on your geo-mojo and go find it.

Enjoyed the puzzle. We seemed to be about 50ft off though. TFTC.</p>

I had to renew my permit with the CDC and in doing so, I trolled out here verified that the infectious ooze is fully within specification and industry accepted tolerance.   Ooze On!</p>

This was a great cache, however on this day I considered it a FIFM cache (Fun, Invigorating, Frustrating and Maddening), especially when the cache was not replaced in the proper spot by the previous cacher!  Thanks anyway!!</p>

I got a complaint from the CDC about oozy rat this weekend.     I went out tonight in the dark and verified that the infectious ooze is fully within specification and industry accepted tolerance. (Although I realize now I did misstate the cache container to the reporting officer when confronted.   It's, uuuuh, smaller than I said.)</p>

In the expectation that this cache will get some traffic in the next 48 hours, Ryan and I checked it earlier today.   The Rat is Oozing just as we planned it.</p>

It won't earn him a smiley face, but I've confirmed that rickrich would have indeed sunk the battleship!      Thanx for playing. You get a copy of the home game and some rice-a-roni...</p>
