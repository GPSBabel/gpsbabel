Removed the container from the final location. Enough construction has occurred since this was placed to make it much less of an adventure than is used to be, so I'm archiving.

Thanx to all that hunted it.</p>

Most of my mom's side of the family still lives in the McEwen and Dickson areas, so I am down this way quite a bit.  Yesterday (and the day before), my sister and I spent some time (again) in Clarksville, experiencing more government incompetence.  Today, I started the trip home with a stop at a cache I had tried nine years ago (!).  We found that one, and one other that I had also previously DNFed, and then I dropped her off and started the drive from Dickson to Nashville...  Funny story - Nashville is a little bit out of the way on that drive.  I am (still) trying to complete a Charter Member challenge, and Mr. Lipe is on that rarefied list.  Since he only has a few caches currently active, I targeted a puzzle that I was able to solve.  I DNFed that one last time I was in the area (yes, this one), and I DNFed it again today (yes, still this one).  I do that a lot.  In my defense, I was able to solve the puzzle, and I think I found the original hiding spot and the hiding spot other finders mentioned.  I really hope this one is not gone, as I think I have an idea on the container, and I enjoyed both of my visits here.  This one more than the last one, as last time it was pouring down rain.</p>

I was down for another fun filled weekend of dealing with family issues, so I needed a break from the crazy before I went back home to deal with my own family issues.  I left Dickson this morning, and was hoping the rain wouldn't be too bad as I was trying to grab some very specific caches on the way home.  This was specific cache number 1.  I am currently 98.89% sure I solved this one correctly...  That said, my Oregon was pointing in a direction that was clearly marked as not the right spot.  I read a few old logs, and decided to try moving the search 65' NE/NNE.  I came up with a great new location, but the rain was starting in earnest, and I still had a lot of windshield time ahead of me.  I got wetter than I wanted to, and could not make the find.  On the plus side, I will be down this way a lot over the next several months to next several years, so I will have to try again.  I have a few other ideas that I was pondering as I drove, so I am going to poke at them next.  The find rate on this one for me was 00.00%.  HA!</p>

After taking a nice walk with Gal to this one, we didn't have any luck right away. We searched all over the place, until she read a hint that sure helped out a lot. [:D] TFTF</p>

Fuzzy and I were off for a quick getaway to see some of the highlights of the area and score a few caches in Tennessee and Alabama. This was one of a handful of Mystery caches I solved back home. 

Chuck and I were halfway to this one after completing a nearby Challenge, so we continued on to check out, “Oozy rat in a sanitary zoo.” Along the way we spied two deer and a lion, making this a real animal adventure.

After poking around Ground Zero for a couple of minutes we read the logs. After going the 65’ NE as others have stated, we found the container in the first place we checked. We signed in and replaced as found. 

We really enjoyed the hike to this one. The views from the boardwalk were just lovely. As we stood there, we saw several hot air balloons take off in the distance. Thanks for the fantastic Fall faraway fun!</p>

I've had this one solved for a long time - or so I thought. Went hunting for it and found nada. Used a PAF and found out I had clearly solved the puzzle wrong - although I sort of had the right idea. LOL. Found the right spot and signed the log this time. Thanks for the puzzle fun.</p>

Whew...3 tries over a year and finally found it.  Great one and we are going for celebratory BBQ.  Log was missing so we put a long piece of paper in there for the time being.  Good luck!</p>

I had to renew my permit with the CDC and in doing so, I trolled out here verified that the infectious ooze is fully within specification and industry accepted tolerance.   Ooze On!</p>

I got a complaint from the CDC about oozy rat this weekend.     I went out tonight in the dark and verified that the infectious ooze is fully within specification and industry accepted tolerance. (Although I realize now I did misstate the cache container to the reporting officer when confronted.   It's, uuuuh, smaller than I said.)</p>

In the expectation that this cache will get some traffic in the next 48 hours, Ryan and I checked it earlier today.   The Rat is Oozing just as we planned it.</p>

It won't earn him a smiley face, but I've confirmed that rickrich would have indeed sunk the battleship!      Thanx for playing. You get a copy of the home game and some rice-a-roni...</p>
