      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The cache is not at the coordinates above. These coords will get
you to the correct park and within 1/2 mile of the cache. The cache
is within 35 feet of the trail. It is not handicapped accessible.
It is a nice walk in the woods that is practical for all ages.
There is no space in the container for trading items. You should
bring a writing stick and bug spray is recommended.

Now that it's intuitively obvious to even the most casual observer
where the cache is, turn on your geo-mojo and go find it. &lt;br&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Most of my mom's side of the family still lives in the McEwen and Dickson areas, so I am down this way quite a bit.  Yesterday (and the day before), my sister and I spent some time (again) in Clarksville, experiencing more government incompetence.  Today, I started the trip home with a stop at a cache I had tried nine years ago (!).  We found that one, and one other that I had also previously DNFed, and then I dropped her off and started the drive from Dickson to Nashville...  Funny story - Nashville is a little bit out of the way on that drive.  I am (still) trying to complete a Charter Member challenge, and Mr. Lipe is on that rarefied list.  Since he only has a few caches currently active, I targeted a puzzle that I was able to solve.  I DNFed that one last time I was in the area (yes, this one), and I DNFed it again today (yes, still this one).  I do that a lot.  In my defense, I was able to solve the puzzle, and I think I found the original hiding spot and the hiding spot other finders mentioned.  I really hope this one is not gone, as I think I have an idea on the container, and I enjoyed both of my visits here.  This one more than the last one, as last time it was pouring down rain.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was down for another fun filled weekend of dealing with family issues, so I needed a break from the crazy before I went back home to deal with my own family issues.  I left Dickson this morning, and was hoping the rain wouldn't be too bad as I was trying to grab some very specific caches on the way home.  This was specific cache number 1.  I am currently 98.89% sure I solved this one correctly...  That said, my Oregon was pointing in a direction that was clearly marked as not the right spot.  I read a few old logs, and decided to try moving the search 65' NE/NNE.  I came up with a great new location, but the rain was starting in earnest, and I still had a lot of windshield time ahead of me.  I got wetter than I wanted to, and could not make the find.  On the plus side, I will be down this way a lot over the next several months to next several years, so I will have to try again.  I have a few other ideas that I was pondering as I drove, so I am going to poke at them next.  The find rate on this one for me was 00.00%.  HA!</groundspeak:text>

Fuzzy and I were off for a quick getaway to see some of the highlights of the area and score a few caches in Tennessee and Alabama. This was one of a handful of Mystery caches I solved back home. 

Chuck and I were halfway to this one after completing a nearby Challenge, so we continued on to check out, “Oozy rat in a sanitary zoo.” Along the way we spied two deer and a lion, making this a real animal adventure.

After poking around Ground Zero for a couple of minutes we read the logs. After going the 65’ NE as others have stated, we found the container in the first place we checked. We signed in and replaced as found. 

We really enjoyed the hike to this one. The views from the boardwalk were just lovely. As we stood there, we saw several hot air balloons take off in the distance. Thanks for the fantastic Fall faraway fun!</groundspeak:text>
