GPSBabel Version 1.6.0.  https://www.gpsbabel.org

Usage:
    ./gpsbabel [options] -i INTYPE -f INFILE [filter] -o OUTTYPE -F OUTFILE
    ./gpsbabel [options] -i INTYPE -o OUTTYPE INFILE [filter] OUTFILE

    Converts GPS route and waypoint data from one format type to another.
    The input type and filename are specified with the -i INTYPE
    and -f INFILE options. The output type and filename are specified
    with the -o OUTTYPE and -F OUTFILE options.
    If '-' is used for INFILE or OUTFILE, stdin or stdout will be used.

    In the second form of the command, INFILE and OUTFILE are the
    first and second positional (non-option) arguments.

    INTYPE and OUTTYPE must be one of the supported file types and
    may include options valid for that file type.  For example:
      'gpx', 'gpx,snlen=10' and 'ozi,snlen=10,snwhite=1'
    (without the quotes) are all valid file type specifications.

Options:
    -p               Preferences file (gpsbabel.ini)
    -s               Synthesize shortnames
    -r               Process route information
    -t               Process track information
    -T               Process realtime tracking information
    -w               Process waypoint information [default]
    -b               Process command file (batch mode)
    -x filtername    Invoke filter (placed between inputs and output) 
    -D level         Set debug level [0]
    -h, -?           Print detailed help and exit
    -V               Print GPSBabel version and exit
