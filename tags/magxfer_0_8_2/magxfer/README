Magxfer uploads detail and base maps to Magellan's mapping GPS receivers
under POSIX operating systems like UnixWare, OpenServer, Linux, FreeBSD,
Solaris, and OpenBSD.  It is most useful on the 330 and SportTrak;
Meridians can just read the maps from the SD cards.

It does **not** create or edit those maps; for that you must still
use Mapsend.  But once you've used Mapsend to create the maps, you
may keep a collection of *.img files on your UNIX system and use this
utility to shoot them into your receiver.  The files you need are in the
"export/images" in whatever location you installed Mapsend.

Usage is simple:

	magxfer [-p portname] [-b bitrate] -f filetosend.img

	portname specifies the serial port to use.  The default 
		is "/dev/ttyS0" which is the first serial port on a 
		Linux PC.

	bitrate specifies the speed to send the upload command.  The
		default is 4800.   After connection is made, the actual
		transfer happens at 115200 bps, regardless of this option.

	filetosend.img is the image file you wish to upload to the unit.
