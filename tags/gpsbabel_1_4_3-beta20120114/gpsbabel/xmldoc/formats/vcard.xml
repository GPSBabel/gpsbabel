enables waypoints to be viewed with an Apple iPod. This is achieved by
mapping waypoint fields into vCard fields that can be displayed as
'Contacts' on the iPod. With the iPod mounted as a hard disk (see your
iPod manual for instructions), the resulting VCF file should be moved
into the iPod 'Contacts' folder. As an alternative, Mac OS X users may
prefer to drag the VCF file into their address book and synchronize
with the iPod using iSync.
