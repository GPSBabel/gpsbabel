<para>The following baud rates can be used: 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400.
Note that your logger might not support all of them (especially 230400 which isn't documented
in the chipset manual, though there are known devices that are capable of this speed).

<para>If <userinput>baud=0</userinput> (zero) download takes place at the baud rate the
device is currently set to. This is especially useful for Bluetooth connections (if available) since they
often don't allow changing the baud rate.</para>
