	The Holux m241 is a small datalogger using the MTK chipset, with 
	a couple small differences in the binary format. In its default 
	configuration, it can store ~100000 trackpoints with very limited
	 data; to configure extended logging you can use the BT747 open 
	source software 
         <ulink url="http://bt747.wiki.sourceforge.net">bt747</ulink>
	 Waypoint storage is possible only if "recording reason" (RCR) is enabled in the settings.

	Holux GPSport 245 is a datalogger with display suitable for cycling, walking and running. 
        It can store ~200k trackpoints with limited data. The m241 and m241-bin format is 
        able to automatically detect GPSport 245 data and handle the differences from Holux 241 devices.
        Note: GP245 does not log any quality of the position.

  Most of the loggers cannot receive bluetooth commands, they can only send
  data. Since GPSBabel needs to send commands to the GPS device it won't
  work. Download the data using the USB cable instead.
