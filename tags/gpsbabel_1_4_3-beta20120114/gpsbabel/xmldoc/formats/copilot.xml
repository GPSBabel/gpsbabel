Planner for Palm/OS"</ulink> databases into other formats.  You probably should
not use this to write CoPilot databases, although the code is there,
because GPSBabel doesn't convert magnetic declination values.</para>
<para>This version now reads all CoPilot file versions up to 4, but only
writes version 4 files.  If you have a need for a version flag, please let
me know.</para>
