<para>
This option is used to change the locations of waypoints without losing any 
of the other associated information.  When this option is specified, the 
latitude and longitude from later duplicates will replace the latitude and
longitude in the original waypoint.
</para>
<para>
As an example, this option may be used to adjust the locations of "puzzle" 
geocaches in a Groundspeak pocket query:
</para>
<example id="Correcting_Cache_Locations">
<title>Using the duplicate filter to correct the locations of "puzzle"
geocaches</title>
<para><userinput>gpsbabel -i gpx -f 43622.gpx -i csv -f corrections.csv -x duplicate,shortname,correct -o gpx -F 43622-corrected.gpx</userinput></para>
<para>
After this command is run, the waypoints in the output file will have all 
of the descriptive information from <filename>43622.gpx</filename>, but 
waypoints that were also found in <filename>corrections.csv</filename> 
will have their coordinates replaced with the coordinates from that file.
</para>
