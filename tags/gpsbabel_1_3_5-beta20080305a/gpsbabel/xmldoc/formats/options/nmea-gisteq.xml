  The Gisteq PhotoTrackr is a GPS data logger hardware and software package
  that allows one to easily record the locations of where the user has taken
  photos.  The PhotoTrackr software works by comparing EXIF timestamps in
  digital photos with the timestamps in the tracking data.  In doing so, the
  software plots the locations of the photos using Google Maps.  The logging
  format used by the Gisteq hardware is very close to NMEA format, but with a
  few small quirks.
