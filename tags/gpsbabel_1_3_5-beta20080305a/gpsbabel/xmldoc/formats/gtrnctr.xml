GPSBabel has limited support for Garmin Training Center files.   That program is the successor to Garmin' Logbook program for their workout units.  It is a free upgrade.

This format is somewhat underachieving in GPSBabel.  It is a write-only
format; we never read it.  The bigger problem, however, is a fundamental
impedance mismatch between this format and most of what we support.  GPSBabel
fundamentally deals in waypoints, tracks, and routes.  While we do record
things like heart rate and temperature when we know it, the fundamentals
of Training Center are different - it deals in concepts like laps and calories
which are rather alien to GPSBabel and most of the formats we support.  As 
such, while we can describe the tracks pretty accurately, things like 
calories and heart zone tracking are not supported.
