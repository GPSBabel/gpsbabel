Explorist 500, Explorist 600, Explorist 210, and Explorist XL 
to describe geocaches.  Notice what while the format can
hold an infinite number of geocaches, the unit will read and silently
discard all but 200 geocache POIs at a time.</para>
      <para> You should name any file created with this format with a
".gs" extension so the firmware can read it.
