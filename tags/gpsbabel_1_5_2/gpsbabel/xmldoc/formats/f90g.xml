This format is for the .map files produced by the F90G automobile
Digital Video Recorder (DVR) when recording videos.  The files are
found on the sd card in /DCIM/DCIMA/NORMAL/ and are named with a time
stamp and the .map extension.  This format records each track point's
latitude, longitude, local time, GMT time and velocity in Kilometers
Per Hour.  The local time is used in the gpsbabel translation.
Minutes, seconds and the velocity are combined to form each track point's
name in the converted trace.
