<para>This option lets you read the control points
(start, end, vias, and stops) for your route as well as the route
itself.  The default for this option is 'none', which won't read the
control points.  You may also specify 'waypoints', which reads the
control points as waypoints, or 'route', which creates an extra route
named 'control points' containing just the control points in order.
Note that if your goal is to create an arc or other CSV file, you
should use 'none' (or not use this option, which is the same
thing.)</para>
