CompeGPS data files are those read and written by the
<productname>CompeGPS</productname> TwoNav software (running on a Mac, a PC,
or on select cell phones) as well as  CompeGPS Land, and CompeGPS Air.  
These files are also used by the CompeGPS TwoNav Aventura and TwoNav Sportiva GPS receivers when they are in mass storage mode.

Release 6.1 of CompeGPS Land and CompeGPS Air added GPX as an import export format for waypoints, routes, and tracks.   As GPX is a more heavily used format, you should probably use that for new applications.
