Internally, this is actually a serial device that has a serial/USB adapter
built into it.  It uses the CP210x chip by Silicon labs.   You will probably
need a driver for this chip.  The product ships with one for Windows.  
The Linux 210x driver seems to work fine.  Mac users will need to download 
the <ulink url="http://www.silabs.com/tgwWebApp/public/web_content/products/Microcontrollers/USB/en/mcu_vcp.htm">Mac driver for CP210x</ulink>.

GPSBabel does not try to offer an interface to configure these units. That
is left to the Windows software that comes with it or tools like the
