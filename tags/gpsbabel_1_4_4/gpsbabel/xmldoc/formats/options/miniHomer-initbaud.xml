This function is identical to the init-baud file function of skytraq module. 
</para>
<para>The "initbaud" option might be helpful if autodetection fails or takes too long. With this option you
can tell GPSBabel the baud rate the device is currently set to. In contrast, the option "baud" specifies
the rate at which the actual download should take place. If it is different than "initbaud" (or the autodetected
rate, if initbaud wasn't given), the initial setting will be restored after finishing the download.

Please note that miniHomer by default uses 38400bps and does not autodetect the port speed. If you need autodetect, start as
<userinput>gpsbabel -i miniHomer,initbaud=0 -f /dev/ttyUSB0 -o gpx -F out.gpx</userinput>
