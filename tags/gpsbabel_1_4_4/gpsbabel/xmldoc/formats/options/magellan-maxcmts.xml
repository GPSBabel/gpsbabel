Magellan receivers allow a maximum of 200 waypoint comments.  Unfortunately,
DirectRoute uses waypoint comments to provide next turn directions for
navigation pop-ups and that comes from that pool of 200 comments.  It
is therefore sometimes convenient to limit the number of waypoint 
comments written to the receiver.   For example, a geocacher might want
to upload 400 waypoints, but only 190 with comments so that DirectRoute
could provide driving directions for the next ten turns.
