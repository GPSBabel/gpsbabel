GPSBabel supports .wpr and .trl files for Alan Map500 devices running operating 
system versions 2.xx.
</para>

<para>
.wpr files contain waypoints and routes. If you use a CF-Card based
operating system, waypoint files must have a <filename>.WPR</filename> extension when
copied to the CF-Card. The default filename is <filename>TEMPWPRT.WPR</filename>.
Only one <filename>.WPR</filename> file may be present.

<para>
Alan's operating system 3.0 for Map500 is not supported yet.
At the time of this writing, OS3 is still beta.
Documentation on the new dataformats is sparse.
</para>

<para>
The Alan Map500 handheld GPSr is identical to the Holux GM101.
This GPSBabel module has only been tested against the Alan Map500.
Still, if you use a GM101, GPSBabel will probably be able to convert
your waypoints, routes and tracklogs.
