         <para> The input track will be split into several tracks
         depending on date of track points. If there is more than one
         track, use the pack option before before using this.  To
         split a single tracks into separate tracks for each day and
         name them, use this:
      </para>
         <para><userinput> gpsbabel -t -i gpx -f in.gpx -x track,split,title="ACTIVE LOG # %Y%m%d" -o gpx -F out.gpx</userinput></para>
         <para> If the input has multiple tracks, pack them together before
splitting them back apart per day thusly: </para>
         <para><userinput>     	    gpsbabel -t   -i gpx -f in.gpx  
     -x track,pack,split,title="ACTIVE LOG # %D"  	
     -o gpx -F out.gpx</userinput></para>
         <para> Additionally you can add an interval to the split
         option.  With this the track will be split if the time
         between two points is greater than this parameter. The
         interval must be numeric and can be int days, hours, minutes
         or seconds, expressed as one of the character "d", "h", "m",
         or "s".  If no trailing character is present, the units are
         assumed to be in seconds.
</para>
         <para> For example, to split a track based on an four hour
         interval, use this:</para>
         <para><userinput>            
gpsbabel -t 
     -i gpx -f in.gpx 
     -x track,pack,split=4h,title="LOG # %c" 
     -o gpx -F out.gpx
</userinput></para>
