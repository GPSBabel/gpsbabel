GPSBabel is distributed "ready to run" on most common 
operating systems via the 
<ulink url="http://www.gpsbabel.org/download.html">download page</ulink>.
</para>
  <para> As GPSBabel runs on a wide variety of operating systems,
be sure to visit the

 For operating systems where no binary is provided or if 
you want the latest development version, you will have to build it from
source.  The code should be compilable on any system with
ISO C89 compilers.  It's been tested on UnixWare, OpenServer, OS/X,
Linux, Solaris, and a variety of processors and compilers.

  In most cases, the code is as simple to build as running:
 <screen format="linespecific">./configure &amp;&amp; make</screen>

  <para><ulink url="http://expat.sourceforge.net">Expat</ulink> 
is strongly recommended for source builds as it is
required for reading all the XML formats such as GPX.
