<para>
This format, like the <link linkend="fmt_custom">custom</link> format, is
mainly used for the purpose of testing GPSBabel.  It is supposed to contain
one field for each piece of information supported by the 
<link linkend="fmt_xcsv">xcsv</link> format writer, but it may not be entirely
in sync with the documentation at <xref linkend="Styles" />.

For a list of fields, see the style/tabsep.style file in the GPSBabel source
distribution.
