<para>
This filter modifies any tracks so that either the distance or the time
between consecutive points is no less than the specified interval. Where
points are missing, the filter fills them in by following a straight 
line (actually a great circle) between the adjacent points.  You
must specify either the 
<option>distance</option> or the <option>time</option> option.
