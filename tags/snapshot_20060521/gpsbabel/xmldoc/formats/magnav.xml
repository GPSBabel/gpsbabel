for this sort of use, but its file format is supported and with a
little bit of patience you can both read and write NAV Companion
waypoints.  Please read README.magnav for further tips on getting
waypoints in and out of NAV Companion.  This conversion is based on
partially incomplete reverse-engineering of the record format, so it
may not work with all versions of NAV Companion.  It has been tested
with version 2.10 and 3.20.</para>
