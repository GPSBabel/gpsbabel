not yet completely documented.  THE .PSP MODULE DOES NOT WORK WITH MS
STREETS &amp; TRIPS 2002 .EST FILES.  To create .PSP files from
Streets &amp; Trips 2002, you will need to have PocketStreets support
installed.
         </para>
      <para>Please note that MS Streets &amp; Trips only *EXPORTS*
.PSP files. It does not import them.  MS Streets &amp; Trips 2002 only
imports CSV files.  To use .PSP files, simply copy them over to the
same folder on the mobile device as the map (.MPS), and open
PocketStreets.  It should also be noted that in the case a pushpin is
outside of the exported map area, the pin will be "grayed-out" and
unused in PocketStreets. This is a good thing as it allows us to
create one big .PSP file that covers multiple .MPS files.
Unfortunately, you need one .PSP file for every .MPS file. :(</para>
