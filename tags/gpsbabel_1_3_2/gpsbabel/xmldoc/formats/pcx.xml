the lame NMEA six-character waypoint names that's treated as a
second-class citizien in current versions of MapSource.  In Mapsource,
use file-&gt;import to read these files.  If you name the files *.wpt,
Mapsource will find them easier.
</para>
      <para> In general, you should prefer the "mapsource" file format
to this one.
