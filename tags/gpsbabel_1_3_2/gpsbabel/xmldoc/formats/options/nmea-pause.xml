<para>
This option tells GPSBabel to pause between individual track records when
used on output.  This may be used with appropriate external software or 
hardware to simulate a GPS receiver for testing purposes.  On Unix, for
example, you may use a named pipe to feed the output from GPSBabel to gpsd.

<para>
If a value for this option is specified, it is in seconds and it may be
either a whole number of seconds or a fraction (e.g. 0.5 for a 1/2 second
pause between trackpoints.)
</para>
<para>
If this option is specified without a value, the time between adjacent 
trackpoints will be computed and used for the length of the pause.  That is,
if your trackpoints are 5 seconds apart, GPSBabel will pause 5 seconds 
between trackpoints.
</para>
<para>
Note that very long tracks may be subject to clock drift, as GPSBabel does 
not take into account the amount of time it may take to write the NMEA 
sentences.  Also, there is no guarantee that it will pause for exactly the
specified number of seconds between samples; different operating systems 
will allow greater or lesser precision for timers, so actual precision may
be as much as plus or minus 100 milliseconds.

<para>
If you are using this option with compressed or simplified tracks from 
your handheld GPS receiver, you might find the
