* Adding your own language to GPSBabelGUI *
-------------------------------------------

In first step you need an editor for so called .PO files.
These files contains the strings needed to be translated.
The basic .po file for GPSBabelGUI is default.po and should be
located in your gui directory. The translation can be done with
any editor, but i suggest poedit (http://www.poedit.org/download.php).
poedit is the "must have" tool for dooing such translations.

If you have done the translation of the billions of message from
the gui have to do the following:

- Download and install the package dxgettext from "http://dybdahl.dk/dxgettext"
- Create a new folder below your gui directory in form
  <your-gui-directory>\locale\<LC>\LC_MESSAGES
- Replace <LC> with the shortcut for your language.
- The file "languagecodes.txt" from dxgettext is good reference for
  finding the valid shortcut.
- (1) Move your new default.po to folder LC_MESSAGE below <your-LC>.
- (2) Right-mouse-click on the .po file ... and you should see a new command
  in your context menu "compile to mo file" ... doit.
- Borland Delphi uses a lot of internal strings, but you don't have to
  translate them too. On
  "http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/dxgettext/trunk/translations/" you will find
  a lot of Delphi internal translations. For our gui you should download
  "delphi.po" for Delphi5 and for <your-LC>
- Repeat steps (1) and (2) for delphi.po
- Start the gui and be happy.

- That's all, but please please please, send us a copy of your translation.
  A mail to gpsbabel-misc@lists.sourceforge.net with your translated
  default.po will be immediatly implemented in the project and will be
  available for many other users.


* Getting the source *
----------------------

There are two ways to get the source of the gui. One of them is source
release package you can download from fourceget. Open "www.gpsbabel.org"
in your browser and go over "downloads" to the download list. The file you
need is called gpsbabel-<version>-<release>.tar.gz. The gui source you will
find in the win32/gui-2 folder.

The second way is to checkout the current development tree with CVS.
At SourceForge.net you will find the infos for working with cvs.

To checkout the gpsbabel source tree the command line should look like this:

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gpsbabel co gpsbabel

This command will create a new folder in your working directory and
receive the complete source tree like the source tree but with all
changes made after the latest release.


* Compiling from source *
-------------------------

Currently the gui is developed under Delphi 4. Other releases of Delphi are
tested but are not used because of backward compatibility. If you want to help
us and Delphi is not in your software collection, "Delphi 6 Personal Edition"
would be the cheapest (or free) way.
