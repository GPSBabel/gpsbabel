<para>
This option is the one most often used with the duplicate filter.  This 
option instructs the duplicate filter to remove any waypoints that share
a short name with a waypoint that has come before.  This option might be
used to remove duplicates if you are merging two datasets that were 
each created in part from a common ancestor dataset.
