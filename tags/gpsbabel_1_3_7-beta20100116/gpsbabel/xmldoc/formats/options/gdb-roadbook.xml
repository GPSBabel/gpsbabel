<para>
  If this option is specified, GPSBabel drops all calculated route points, 
  with exception of points with a description (i.e. "Make U-turns until you know where you are.").
  The priority of this option is higher than of the <option>via</option> option. 
  A value of 1 or y overwrites the <option>via</option> settings.

    Because gdb internally creates a route AND a waypoint list, you have to drop all
    waypoints and transform the route into waypoints in order to get a well ordered
    html output. We suggest these steps for all waypoint-only formats as html.
