If your original waypoint data contains URLs, GPSBabel will include them as
links in the generated drawing file.  This causes the waypoint symbol to have
a blue border, and it causes the waypoint text to be drawn in blue with an 
underline.

If you do not want this behavior, specify the "nourl" option on the command
