Parker.  The output from this module has been tested with GPSPilot
Tracker v5.05sx, but it is based on reverse-engineering so it may not
work with all versions of all GPSPilot products.  It had read-only
support for Airport, Navaid, City and Landmark files but will read and
write Point files.</para>
