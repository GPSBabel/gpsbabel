  iGo8 is the successor to the "iGo My way" software package that is reasonably
  prolific for GPS devices manufactured by Mio, Sony, LG, as well as many other
  small manufacturers.  iGo8 is notable in that it has full 3D rendering of
  terrain as well as buildings and landmarks for most large cities.  The
  software can also be bought pre-loaded on a mico-SD card for use in many PPC
  phones that are GPS enabled.

  The track format used by iGo8 is rather rudimentary, consisting of a list of
  coordinates and a time resolution of 1 second.  While iGo8 supports exporting
  tracks to GPX format, importing tracks is not natively supported.
