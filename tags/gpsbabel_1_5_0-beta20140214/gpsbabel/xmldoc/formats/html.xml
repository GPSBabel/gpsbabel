  GPSBabel's HTML output generates a single HTML file of all of the
  waypoints in the input file.  It supports a number of Groundspeak GPX
  extensions and filters out potentially harmful HTML from the
  input file while maintaining almost all of the source HTML formatting.   
  This makes this format well suited for generating HTML to hand to programs
  like Plucker for putting in a PDA and especially so for "paperless caching"
  for Geocachers with pocket queries.
