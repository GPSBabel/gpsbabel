  The device provides a location finder built from eight LEDs and can use
  those LEDs to guide you to a location.  You can set the target location
  with the 'targetlocation' option.  Use ':' as the delimiter between latitude
  and longitude. Note that GPSBabel terminates after writing the location info
  to the device, i.e. no logging data will be read from it.
