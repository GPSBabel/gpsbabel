# Holux support is a little funky to test.  Becuase it loses precision,
# if we convert it to another format, we lose accuracy (rounding) in the
# coords, so converting it so something else and comparing it never works.
# So we verify that we can read the reference and write it and get an
# identical reference.
gpsbabel -i holux -f ${REFERENCE}/paris.wpo -o holux -F ${TMPDIR}/paris.wpo
# compare ${REFERENCE}/paris.wpo ${TMPDIR}/paris.wpo
