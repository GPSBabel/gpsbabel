	<para>
		This is a write-only format for geotagging videos. It is used for
		videomapping, i.e. filming a trip while creating a GPS trace.
		It will produce a subtitle file in SubRip (.srt) format.
	</para>
	<para>
		Unless the video and the GPS trace start at exactly the same time, you
		will need to synchronize both. For this purpose, film the display of
		your GPS receiver (or any other device) showing GPS time. (Important:
		you need precise GPS time for this; local time, especially from an
		inaccurate clock, will not do for this.) 
	</para>
	<para>
		Determine the position in the video at which the GPS time is visible
		(in hours, minutes and seconds from the beginning of the video) and
		the GPS date and time shown. Specify these as command line options; you
		will need to do this once for each video file.
	</para>
	<para>
		To use these files, choose the same name as for the associated video,
		changing just the extension to .srt, and place the srt file in the same
		directory as the video. Open the video in a media player and the GPS
		coordinates will be shown as subtitles (tested on VLC, your mileage may
		vary).
