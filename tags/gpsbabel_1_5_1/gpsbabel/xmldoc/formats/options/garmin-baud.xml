<para>
Sets baud rate on some Garmin serial unit to the specified baud rate. Garmin protocol uses 9600 bps by default, but there is a rarely documented feature in Garmin binary protocol for switching baud rate. Highest option is 115200.

<para>
Download track log and waypoints 12 times faster than default:
<userinput>
gpsbabel -t -w -i garmin,baud=115200 -f /dev/ttyUSB0 -o gpx -F garmin-serial.gpx
</userinput>
</para>

<para>
At the end of the transfer, baud rate is switched to back to the default 
of 9600. If connection breaks, the unit stucks at high baud rate, a power 
cycle reverts to original state.
</para>

<para>
This option does not affect USB transfer.

Because this feature uses undocumented Garmin protocols, it may or may
not work on your device.  The author reported success with 
eTrex Vista, GPSMAP 76s, and GPS V, but it seems likely to be problematic
on older units and may be more problematic for writing to the device than
reading data from the device.
