The WinTec WBT-202 stores tracks and waypoints on an internal
MICRO-SD Memory card. The log files can be accessed by connecting to an USB
host and setting the device into a mass storage device (MSD) mode. To enter
this mode, attach it to the computer, then hold the power button until the 
GPS and Bluetooth LEDs go out.  It will then behave like an USB Memory stick.
and individual files containing your tracks will show up on the "disk" with
names ending in .tes.   You can use GPSBabel to read these files directly
or copy them to your host computer.

Note that this format is for the TES files on the GPS, it has no relationship
to the .TK2 files created by Wintec's Time Machine software for Windows.

Despite the physical similarity to the 
<productname>Wintec WBT-201</productname>, this is believed to be a rather
different product.  While this GPS probably works fine for 
<link linkend="tracking">realtime tracking</link> over the bluetooth or 
serial lines (once you have appropriate serial drivers), it's expected
to not work with GPSBabel's <link linkend="fmt_wbt">GPSBabel WBT 
Protocol</link> module.
