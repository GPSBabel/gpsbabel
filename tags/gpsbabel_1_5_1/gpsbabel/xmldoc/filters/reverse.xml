	It's mostly useful for those few formats where track/route
	sequence matters and there isn't a way to reverse them using
	the program itself.</para>
         <para> The reversal is performed in the laziest way possible.
        Timestamps are kept with the original waypoints so the
        resulting track or route will have the interesting
        characteristic that time runs backwards.  This tends to make
        Magellan Mapsend, in particular, do a weird thing and place
        each waypoint on a separate day.

         <para> Additionally, if you're using this to reverse a route
         that navigates, say, an exit ramp or a one way street, you
         will be in for unpleasant ride. application cares about
         timestamps
