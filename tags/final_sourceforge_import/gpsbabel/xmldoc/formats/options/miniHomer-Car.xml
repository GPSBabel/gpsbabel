<para>
  The device provides a location finder display supporting five locations "Home", "Car", "Boat", "Heart", "Bar". 
  You can program the location of each either by a keypress on the device (which uses the actual position) 
  or with GPSBabel (which lets you use any position)
  You can set the location of "Car" with the 'Car' option.  Use ':' as the delimiter between latitude, longitude and altitude. 
  You can leave altitude out, in which case it is assumed to be zero.
  Note that GPSBabel terminates after writing the location info to the device, i.e. no logging data will be read from it.
