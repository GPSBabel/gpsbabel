<para>
This option specifies how to represent point data in the draw file.  
Valid waypoint types are "symbol", "text", "mapnote", "circle", and "image".  
The default is "symbol". 
</para>
<para>
If you specify a waypoint type of "image", you should make sure that the
icon descriptions of your waypoints are the full names, including drive letters
and full path, of image files in a format that works with your DeLorme 
product.  Note that this means that the .an1 file you generate will not work
on any computer that does not have those images in the same place; this is 
part of the design of the an1 format and cannot be avoided.
