   The 'mmo' format provides support for binary .mmo files used by the
   Memory-Map Navigator software.

   Our module was reverse engineered from a couple of .mmo files found
   in the www. The results of the writing code have been tested with a current
   Memory-Map Navigator trial ('Viewer') release.

   Because of different file versions and sometimes slightly different file structure
   we cannot ensure, that every .mmo file is loadable at this time. If you have one,
   which causes errors, please provide it [mailto:gpsbabel-misc@lists.sourceforge.net].
