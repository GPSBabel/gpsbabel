#1 Improve device names
  a) switch format
      delbin: device_name == "usb:"
      garmin: device_name = "usb:" + available serial ports.
  b) list only available serial ports (horribly OS specific)

#2 A 'help' button to the right  of formats that opens the online man page.

#3 Upgrade needs dialog checkboxes for "never check again", "include beta" 
    and a button for "check now".
