There are two executables, with just the default output type changed:

istorage-make.exe
	defaults to making OLE IStorages
	made from the distributed source with MSVC 6

its-make.exe
	defaults to making compressed ITS ITStorages
	made from modified source with MSVC 6

Read LICENCE.txt for conditions of distribution and modification.
To use just drag a folder onto the appropriate executable/shortcut.
Don't worry about the warnings saying that the times could not be set.

Enjoy say i,
