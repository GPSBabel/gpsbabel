History:

This app started out as ansi C using gcc as an app to explore the .axe file format,
and with the intention of fitting into the GPSBabel ansi C requirement. 

The pushpin data (UserData) required MS Jet libraries, initially this was done
with ADO in VB, then in C++ using MS #import. Note that the ADO type libraries 
do not support C via #import, and I was not game to even try direct OLE access to the
ADO libraries via COM. 

So now there is an ugly mix of C/C++ in an app that grew organically rather than being designed.
It probably could be implemented a lot cleaner in c++ and with some inteligent use of streams
etc. 

Yeah, ok, I am just an amateur at this...

18-10-2003  look mum! I can open an axe files into OLE storage streams using various tools.
21-10-2003	annotations stream dump
27-10-2003	journey & pushpins export using VB module
 8-11-2003	match journey route-points to pushpins,
			integrate parts into single C/C++ exe (except istorage)
 9-11-2003  fixed invalid gpx.
10-11-2003  gpx import working for routes/tracks to s&t annotation lines.
13-11-2003  export as pcx5 for import into Garmin MapSource
20-11-2003	substantial cleanup
			fixed 8byte alignment in properties.c
			introduced 1byte alignment for journey analysis
			understands most journey options
22-11-2003  explores UDM data
28-11-2003	imports pushpins
			imports lines to v3 annotations (2002+)
