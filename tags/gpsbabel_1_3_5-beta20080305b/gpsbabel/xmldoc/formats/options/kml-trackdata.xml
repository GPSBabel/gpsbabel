This is a boolean flag that controls
whether GPSBabel writes extensive data for each trackpoint generated.
By default computed speed, timestamps, and so on are written with the default
of '1' for this option.   If you are writing large tracks and do not value
this information, you can reduce the size of the generated file substantially
by turning this flag off by setting it to '0'.
