Palm/OS. Working with record definitions provided by MarcoSoft and
further experimentation by Bruce Thompson and "Fuzzy" from the
Geocaching Forums to nail down the format precisely.</para>
      <para> Should work fine for import and export.</para>
      <para> One thing of note, QuoVadis stores all waypoints in a
single Palm Database without using categories. This means that it may
be difficult to keep personal waypoints separate from generated
waypoints. What Bruce recommends is taking the QuoVadisMarkerDB.PDB
file synced down from your Palm Powered device and extract the
waypoints you personally set to a GPX file. Then using GPSBabel's
joining capabilities generate a new PDB file from the personal file
and the other waypoint files of interest.</para>
      <para> Currently the selection of icons to display and the scale
at which to display them is hardcoded. Also there is no support for
notes associated with waypoints. This will be addressed in a future
revision.</para>
