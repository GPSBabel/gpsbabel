<para>
  This format reads the binary (.vtt) track logs recorded by
  <ulink url="http://vitotechnology.com/en/products/smartmap_nokia_series60.html">
  <application>VITO SmartMap for Nokia Series 60</application>
  </ulink> 1.0, a GPS application for smartphones connected to
  NMEA 0183-compatible Bluetooth GPS receivers. It may work
  with .vtt files produced by versions of VITO SmartMap
  for other platforms.
</para>

<para>
  This format was reverse engineered from a .vtt file.
  Currently, the coordinates, altitude, and time are
  available for each point recorded in a track.
  The course speed and heading fields have been identified,
  but the units are not certain and so those fields are ignored.
  The rest of the entry has not yet been decoded. The format
  uses little-endian byte ordering. The application displays
  metric units by default. Time is UTC.

        Probably speed in meters per second as float.
        Ranges 0-~3 in file, seems reasonable since sample
        file was acquired on foot.

        Probably decimal heading multiplied by something.
        Ranges between min and max values possible when
        decoded as integer. Doesn't change when speed field is 0.
        Doesn't change smoothly, jumps around a bit.

        Status field of some kind. Changes only twice in file.
        May contain satellite count or PDOP info, as both are
        reported by the application's GUI.
