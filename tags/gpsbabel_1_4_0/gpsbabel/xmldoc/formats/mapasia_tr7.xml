   <ulink url="http://www.mapking.com/en/">Mapking</ulink> provides a set of tools for GPS 
   navigation.  The location of distributed maps is mainly in Asia, so the software seems 
   not (yet) well known in Europe or US.  Some of the GPS tools (e.g. Mapking 2007 for Windows Mobile) 
   can also be used to write waypoints and save them under the .tr7 format which can be translated by GPSBabel.
