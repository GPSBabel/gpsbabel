<para>
This option assigns a time value to each trackpoint.
</para>
<para>
The value of this option must be in the form of fYYYYMMDDHHMMSS+SS.
</para>
<para>
The parameter f (force) is optional and means that the time value of each trackpoint is replaced.
If f is not specified, the time value of each trackpoint is only replaced when the trackpoint contains no time value.
</para>
<para>
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS is the pattern for the timestamp and is required.
</para>
<para>
The plus sign is the delimiter between the timestamp and the step time in seconds.
The first trackpoint receives the time value of the timestamp and
each following trackpoint receives the timestamp incremented by the step time.
The specification of the steptime is optional.
</para>
<para>
The parameter was added because some software products (e.g. garmin training center)
require a time value for each trackpoint.
