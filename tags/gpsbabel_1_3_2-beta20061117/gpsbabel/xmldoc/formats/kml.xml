KML, the Keyhole Markup Language, is used by Keyhole and
Google Earth.  There are features in this file format that GPSBabel
doesn't support - such as camera views - but waypoints, tracks, and routes 
work well.

Google Earth also uses GPSBabel internally for receiver communications
and several file format imports and exports.
