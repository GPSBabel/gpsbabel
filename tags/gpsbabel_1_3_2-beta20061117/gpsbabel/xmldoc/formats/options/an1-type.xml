<para> This option specifies the type of the drawing layer
to be created.  The supported values are "drawing", "road", "trail",
"waypoint", or "track".  If you do not specify a type, the default
will be either the type of the previous an1 file or "drawing" if there
is no previous file. This lets you merge, for example, two road layers
without having to specify "type=road" for the output.  </para>
