This option specifies at what zoom level Street Atlas will begin showing 
reduced versions of your symbols. The default is 10.  Setting zoom to 0 will 
disable this feature.  Setting it to anything but the default will override 
the zoom level specified on any waypoints that were read from an existing 
an1 file; this is by design.
