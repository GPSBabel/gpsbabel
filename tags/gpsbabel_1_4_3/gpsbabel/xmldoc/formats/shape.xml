      <para>This format reads and writes ESRI shapefiles as best it can.  The
reality is that shapefiles can contain a lot of map-oriented data that does
not convert well to our model of waypoints, tracks, and routes.  Points are
mapped to waypoints. Arcs are mapped to tracks.<para>

If a field is named 'NAME', that will be used for the shortname.  Likewise
for a field named 'URL'.

Given the forced fit nature of conversions between shapefiles and other
common consumer formats, the results of these conversions are frequently disappointing.
A custom converter (perhaps via a modification to our source) will frequently
deliver better results.
