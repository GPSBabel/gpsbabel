  This format is based on significant reverse-engineering and guesswork.
  GPSBabel's output appears to be compatible with the various versions of 
  MapSource.  Icon mapping is attempted between different MapSource versions.  
  Altitude is supported, but proximity and depth are not.

  Naming files *.mps will allow file-&gt;open in Mapsource to find the files 
  more easily.

  Versions 3, 4, and 5 of the Mapsource data format are handled automatically 
  on input.  By default the output is version 5.  (Until 3/2004, it was
  version 3, but since Mapsource updates are free, the convenience of
  having modern icon sets outweighs the backward compatibility concern.
  Users of other versions can either upgrade or specify the switches to
  get output in a compatible format.)  Waypoints, routes, and tracklogs are 
  all handled, but map sets are ignored.
