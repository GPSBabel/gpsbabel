Microsoft's PocketStreets 2002 Pushpin (.PSP) format is
not yet completely documented.  <emphasis>The .PSP module does not work with 
MS Streets &amp; Trips 2002 .EST files</emphasis>  To create .PSP files from
Streets &amp; Trips 2002, you will need to have PocketStreets support
installed.
</para>
<para>
Please note that MS Streets &amp; Trips only <emphasis>exports</emphasis>
.PSP files. It does not import them.  MS Streets &amp; Trips 2002 only
imports CSV files.  To use .PSP files, simply copy them over to the
same folder on the mobile device as the map (.MPS), and open
PocketStreets.  It should also be noted that in the case a pushpin is
outside of the exported map area, the pin will be "grayed-out" and
unused in PocketStreets. This is a good thing as it allows us to
create one big .PSP file that covers multiple .MPS files.
Unfortunately, you need one .PSP file for every .MPS file.

<question>
<para>
Why should I use GPSBabel/psp to make pushpins when Streets &amp; Trips (S&amp;T)
   already does that for me?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
GPSBabel/psp has the advantage of being able to create pushpins 
<emphasis>without</emphasis>
   creating the associated map file and the need to "import" the waypoint
   data into S&amp;T.  Through a series of scripts, you can create a dozen
   or so PSP files in a few seconds as opposed to a few weeks using the
   S&amp;T interface.  The maps are not going to change between sessions, 
   only the pins will.  Why waste all that time creating maps when all you
   really want are updated pins? As an aside, GPSBabel/psp creates points 
   <emphasis>with the proper coordinates</emphasis> 
   where S&amp;T does not in some areas of the U.S. 
   (Nashville, TN for instance).

<para>
I keep getting a blank (32 byte) PSP file.
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
There are either no points to write, or you have botched the command
   line for GPSBabel.  GPSBabel is sensitive to UPPER and lower case 
   on the command line.  A simple command line to create PSP files
   looks like this:
</para>
<para><userinput>gpsbabel -i geo -f geocaching.loc -o psp -F NewOrleans.psp</userinput></para>
<para>
   Note the use of "-f" for INPUT files and "-F" for OUTPUT files.

<qandaentry id="now_what">
<question>
<para>
I've created a PSP file, now what do I do with it?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
To use pushpins in Pocketstreets, you need to have both a map and a
   pushpin file.  These two files must exist in the same folder and have
   exactly the same base name as the map.  For example, the pins that 
   correspond to the map "NewOrleans.mps" should be named "NewOrleans.psp".

I don't have a map.  What do I do now?

</question>
<answer>
<para>
Create one using the "Export map to Pocketstreets" option in S&amp;T.  You
   can also pick up some major city maps on the web from the MS Pocketstreets
   website if you are interested in seeing how it works.

<question>
<para>
I have .EST files, not .PSP files.  What's up with that?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
In order to make PSP files, you need to use the "Export map to 
   Pocketstreets" function in S&amp;T.  .EST files are for use in S&amp;T, not 
   Pocketstreets.

<question>
<para>
 The .PSP files differ when I use GPSBabel/psp versus Pocketstreets to 
   create them.  What's up?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
Pocketstreets makes corrections to the S&amp;T waypoint data upon initial 
   loading. GPSBabel/psp writes PSP files with these corrections already made.

Does GPSBabel/psp work with (Autoroute, Mappoint, etc..) .PSP files?

As of this writing, I haven't seen any so I can't be sure.  If they 
   follow the same layout as S&amp;T 2002, I'd imagine so.

 Does GPSBabel/psp work with (S&amp;T 2001, S&amp;T 2002, etc...) files?

</question>
<answer>
<para>
MS changed the file layout between S&amp;T 2001 and S&amp;T 2002.  The GPSBabel psp
   module is known to work fine with S&amp;T 2002 and 2003.

<question>
<para>
What do you mean S&amp;T writes points with the wrong coordinates?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
At some point in the "Export map to Pocketstreets" function in S&amp;T,
   it goofs the lat/long data.  Points in Nashville tended to shift
   1.4 miles WEST of their original location.  I'm not a geometry buff,
   but I'd imagine they have a reference point for generating coordinates
   that's wrong in (at least) that area.

<qandaentry id="splitting">
<question>
<para>
I have 800 waypoints that cover a dozen or so Pocketstreets maps.  
   Do I need to to split my points up into smaller chunks to match the 
   area covered by the maps?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
 No.  Pocketstreets will "ignore" points that are outside of the map
   area.  Points that are not on the current map will be "grayed out"
   in pushpin explorer in Pocketsreets.  This is the reason the PSP 
   module was written for GPSBabel in the first place.

Just about everything I know about the PSP file format is documented
