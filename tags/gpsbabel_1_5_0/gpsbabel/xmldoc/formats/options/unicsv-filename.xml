<example id="unicsv_filename">
  <title>Example for unicsv filename option to write filenames of input formats.</title>

    The next example ...
    <userinput>
      gpsbabel -i gpx -f file1.gpx -i gdb -f file2.gdb -o unicsv,filename=1 -F result.txt
    </userinput>
    ... could produce following output:
