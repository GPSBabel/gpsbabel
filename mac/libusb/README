This is libusb-1.0.27 from https://libusb.info/.
Since we have such problems with people
getting libusb successfully built - between the Universal Build issues
and the fact that we have to work hard to go find where it's installed
and unravel the shared library thing -it's easier to just include it 
here.

This code is covered under GPL.

This is meant to be a stop-gap until we can get rid of libusb and use
the IoKit framework natively.
