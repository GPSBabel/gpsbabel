Build instructions:

Build from VC++6 project.
Important notes:
* Use of 1-Byte struct alignment is required (rather than the MS default of 8)
  due to the technique used here of overlaying a struct on an input buffer.
* Use of #import at the top of pushpins.cpp requires setting the Visual Studio paths 
  to include ado libraries (c:\program files\common files\system\ado for me) 
  or setting the path explictitly in the #include statement.
* Use of libexpat reqires a separate install of libexpat, and setting the 
  Visual Studio include and library paths to include libexpat. For me these are
  D:\gpsbabel\Expat-1.95.7\Source\lib (for includes) and  D:\gpsbabel\Expat-1.95.7\Libs
  (for libs).

* Where possible, I have disabled MS language extensions (proj setting/c++/customize).
  Exceptions are:
	getopt.c (ms extensions are enabled only for win32)
	properties.c (I have some unitialised arrays in file structs, I should clean this up)
	pushpins.c (lots...)
  But**** I have used various ms specific lib functions: __max, _fullpath,
