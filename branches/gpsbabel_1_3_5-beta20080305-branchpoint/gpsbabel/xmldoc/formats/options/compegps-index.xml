<para>
Because this format supports only one route or track, this option may be used 
on output to select a single route or track from a collection of routes and
tracks read from a more expressive format.  If you have, say, a 
<link linkend="fmt_gpx">gpx</link> file that contains two routes, you may
use this option to write them one at a time to individual files.
