This format is a very flexible module that can be used to read or write 
nearly any plain-text record-based waypoint file.  This flexibility is 
achieved by combining this format with "style" files that describe the 
format of the waypoint files.

<para>
There are several formats built in to GPSBabel that use the underlying xcsv 
machinery.  Each of those formats takes the same options as the xcsv format,
with the obvious exception of the <option>style</option> option.  
Those formats are all based on style files that can be found in 
the "style" directory in the GPSBabel source distribution.
