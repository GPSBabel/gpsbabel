<para> 
This format supports the <ulink url="http://www.delorme.com">DeLorme</ulink> ".an1" drawing file format.  It can 
currently be used to either read or write drawing files.  If you use 
this format to create drawing files with routes or waypoints from another 
source, by default it will create "Red Flag" symbols for waypoints, and 
thick red lines for routes or tracks.  It is possible to merge two drawing 
layers by doing something like this:
</para>

<para><userinput>gpsbabel -i an1 -f one.an1 -f two.an1 -o an1 -F merged.an1</userinput></para>

<para> 
In this case, the merged data will contain all of the
properties of the original data.
