<para>
This is a textual format that contains nearly all of the information 
contained in the <productname>MapSource</productname> main format, <link linkend="fmt_gdb">GDB</link>.
This format also contains some computed values such as distances between 
routepoints and trackpoints, speed, and course (heading).

The main goal of garmin_txt is to make aviation data more available. Because 
<productname>MapSource</productname> supports only the export, GPSBabel gives you the possibility to 
bring aviation data into <productname>MapSource</productname>.
</para>
<para>
During the export with <productname>MapSource</productname>, some fields are written using local settings
of <productname>MapSource</productname> and Windows. These include grid format, gps datum, distance and
temperature units, and the representation of date and time fields. GPSBabel 
tries to read all items automatically. Problems with date and time format can 
be solved with the 'date' and 'time' options.
