# 24173415.CSV from Columbus P-1 Mark II
# The format differs from the V900: it isn't padded with nulls, has slightly different field lengths,
# and doesn't have the VOX field.
# It does contains 'T' and 'C' tags.  The dupe check should keep the 'C' tags from being duplicated 
# in the track becasue they are at identical times/positions/etc. to 'T' tags.
# We also exercises the time zone option.
