WARNING 
*******
ms2gpx could corrupt Microsoft Streets & Trips, Autoroute and Mappoint files.
ms2gpx is based on my (James Sherring) limited understanding and guessing of Microsoft file formats.
These file formats are undocumented, vary between products and versions, and certainly have information
that I do not understand. 

There is no guarantee that this program will work correctly. 
It is possible that it will import or export data erroneously,
corrupt your data files, 
that files modified by st2gpx will crash applications using them,
or that there will be other loss of data or other effects.

It is recommended that you backup any data before using this program.

Usage of this program indicates that you understand this risk and assume all responsibility for your data.
