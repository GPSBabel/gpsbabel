To do:

	
	import/export more data for pushpins, including symbol, set name(use join on read)
	option to show ppin names/info on import
	center and size map on annotations.

	Get point info for non-line annotations, e.g. text boxes.
	import route as s&t route (Journey), i.e. not just as a line.
	support unicode names (remove str2ascii)

	different colours for imported routes & tracks
	export lines with arrows as routes?
	put some of the ole properties into gpx file comments

	clean up main + string names. Just use stfile+path. Debug read other files
	clean up gpx points/ms points/ names ms2latlon etc
	clean up import structures, make like contents import?

	support drive-time zones in annotations stream?

	fix ppin import for longer renderdata

Still to test:
* various versions, esp import
* multiple imports
* import to file with existing data
* import to empty file
* meaning of options etc for v4 files
