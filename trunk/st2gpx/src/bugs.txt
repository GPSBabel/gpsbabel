Features:

	Depends on ADO2.5

	Known to work with Autoroute 2001, 

	Probably works with Autoroute 2002-3, Streets & Trips 2000-4, Mappoint 2000-4, 
	but not fully tested 

	Overwrites output files without warning


Bugs:

	Problem with input name "steph's  wedding.est",
	but "steph's wedding.est" is ok (single space)
	
	with input file "Plesivec - Plešivec.gpx" we fail to open the gpx as input

	jlps coredump only with release build
	(-G output\jlps.gpx -M output\jlps.rte input\jlps.axe)
	problem seems to be in (compiler) cleanup at end of pcx5_write_jour_pt, after pcx5_write_pt
