This directory is a subset of coldsync-2.2.5.  GPSbabel needs very 
limited set of that functionality to read and write Palm/OS files.  
I was faced with either reimplementing it (and I DON'T want to 
become a Palm/OS expert) or cribbing the code.   Since it's all under 
Artistic license, I took libpdb and the includes, whacked out the most 
horribly non-portable pieces, jacked in a constand config.h, and pointed 
the makefiles to it.
