<title>GPSBabel XCSV Style Files</title>
<para>
The format of an XCSV style file is quite simple and designed to be easily
implemented by non-programmers to handle "one-off" babel-ization of various
XCSV (whatever separated values) text files.  The format and usage of the 
various style directives are described below.
</para>
<para>
The first and foremost important step is understanding how the config
file is laid out itself.  The format is:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">DIRECTIVE&lt;whitespace&gt;VALUE</screen>
<para>
Where &lt;whitespace&gt; is a space, tab, spaces, tabs, etc...  There should
be nothing before the directive.  (i.e. not "  DIRECTIVE  VALUE")
</para>
<section id="styles_internal_const">
<title>Internal Constants</title>
<para>
A few internal constants are defined in the XCSV parser to make the style
file simpler.  They may or may not be used and are optional in most cases. 
Note that only certain style file directives map these constants.

<section id="style_const_whitespace">
<title>WHITESPACE</title>
<para>
The WHITESPACE constant has special properties.  When reading data, 
WHITESPACE refers to sequential runs of SPACES and/or TABS.  When
writing data, WHITESPACE is always a single SPACE.
</para>
<para>
For example, the following line:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">
SOME_NAME       30.1208 -91.1365    SOME OTHER NAME
</screen>
<para>
Parses into the following data fields: 
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">
SOME_NAME,30.1208,-91.1365,SOME,OTHER,NAME
</screen>
</section>

<section id="style_const_comments">
<title>COMMENTS</title>
<para>
Anything after a hash (#) on a line is not parsed.  For example:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">
#THIS ENTIRE LINE IS A COMMENT.
#FIELD	LAT_DECIMAL, "", "%f"   THIS ENTIRE LINE IS A COMMENT
FIELD LAT_DECIMAL, "", "%f"  # ONLY THIS SENTENCE IS A COMMENT.

<title>Defining the Layout of the File</title>
<para>
The first few directives define the layout the physical file itself:
</para>

<section id="style_layout_field">
<title>FIELD_DELIMITER</title>
<para>
   The field delimiter defines the character(s) that separate the fields in 
   the rows of data inside the XCSV file.  Common field delimiters are commas 
   and tabs. (referred to as "comma separated values" and "tab separated 
   values")
</para>
<para>
   examples: 
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">
   FIELD_DELIMITER    COMMA
   FIELD_DELIMITER    ~

   the table above.
</para>
</section>

<section id="style_layout_rec">
<title>RECORD_DELIMITER</title>
<para>
   The record delimiter defines that character(s) that separate ROWS of 
   data (FIELDS) in the XCSV file.  The most common record delimiters
   are NEWLINE and CR (carriage return).
</para>
<para>
   examples:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">
   RECORD_DELIMITER    NEWLINE
   RECORD_DELIMITER    |

   in the table above.
</para>
</section>

<section id="style_layout_badchars">
<title>BADCHARS</title>
<para>   
   Bad characters are things that should *never* be written into the XCSV
   file as data on output.  GPSBabel automatically includes any non-blank
   FIELD_DELIMITER and RECORD_DELIMITER characters as BADCHARS by default.
</para>
<para>
   examples: 
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">
  BADCHARS    COMMA
  BADCHARS    ~|

<para>
   The directive BADCHARS is parsed for STYLE CONSTANTS as defined in the 
   table above.
</para>
</section>

<section id="style_layout_prologue">
<title>PROLOGUE</title>
<para>
   A prologue is basically constant data that is written to the output
   file BEFORE any waypoints are processed.  PROLOGUE can be defined 
   multiple times in the style file, once for each "line" before the data 
   begins.  This is commonly used in XCSV files as a "header" row.  
</para>
<para>
   examples: 
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">
  PROLOGUE	OziExplorer Waypoint File Version 1.1
  PROLOGUE	WGS 84
  PROLOGUE	Symbol,Name,Latitude,Longitude

   An Epilogue is the same as a prologue, except this data is written at 
   the END of the file.  See the examples for PROLOGUE above.
</para>
</section>
</section> <!-- layout -->

<section id="style_define">
<title>Defining Fields Within the File</title>
<para>
A field defines data.  There are two different classifications of FIELDS,
IFIELD (file input) and OFIELD (file output).  In the absence of any OFIELDS,
IFIELDS are use as both input and output.  The existence of OFIELDS is 
primarily to allow more flexible mapping of GPSBabel data to output data 
(say, for instance, to map the internal GPSBabel "description" variable to 
two or more fields on output).  For all practical purposes, IFIELDS and 
OFIELDS are defined the same way in the style file.  The following options
are defined:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
   "no_delim_before" is supported on OFIELD tags to specify that this
   field should be written without a field delimiter before it.  It's
   useful for limited field concatenation.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
   "absolute" is supported on OFIELD tags for lat and lon to indicate
   that only absolute values (never negative) are to be printed.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
There are several different types of fields that may be defined.  Each field 
consists of three pieces of information: the FIELD TYPE, a DEFAULT VALUE, and 
a PRINTF CONVERSION (for output).  In many cases, not all pieces are used,
but all 3 pieces are required.   Additionally, an fourth field is supported
that modifies the behaviour of the field being described.
</para>
<para>
FIELDS should be defined in the style file in the logical order that they
appear in the data, from left to right.  This is the order in which they are
parsed from input and written to output.
</para>
<para>
The fields used by the XCSV parser are as follows:
</para>

<section id="style_def_ignore">
<title>IGNORE</title>
<para>
   IGNORE fields are, guess what, ignored on input.   Internally, IGNORE 
   fields are treated as CHARACTER data, and as such, require a printf 
   conversion for a character array.  
</para>
<para>
examples:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">
   IFIELD IGNORE,"","%14.14s"   # (writes a 14 character blank field)
   IFIELD IGNORE,"","%s"        # (writes a blank field on output)
</screen>
</section>

<section id="style_def_constant">
<title>CONSTANT</title>
<para>
   CONSTANT fields are, of course, constant.  They are ignored on input, 
   however they write CONSTANT data on output.  As such, they require a 
   DEFAULT VALUE and a printf conversion for a character array. 
</para>
<para>
examples:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">
   IFIELD CONSTANT,"FFFFFF","%s"   # (writes "FFFFFF" in the field)
   IFIELD CONSTANT,"01/01/70","%s" # (a constant date field)
</screen>
</section>

<section id="style_def_index">
<title>INDEX</title>
<para>
   An INDEX field is used ONLY on output.  The INDEX constant defines a field 
   that, at output, contains the sequence number of the waypoint being 
   written, starting at 0.  An index is managed internally as an INTEGER 
   and requires an INTEGER printf conversion.  An INDEX has one special
   property.  The DEFAULT VALUE of the index is added to the index 
   on each iteration (to allow indexes starting at 1, 100, etc..).   
</para>
<para>
examples:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">
   IFIELD INDEX,"0","%04d"     # (Starts counting at zero)
   IFIELD INDEX,"","%04d"      # (Starts counting at zero)
   IFIELD INDEX,"1","%04d"     # (Starts counting at one)
</screen>
</section>

<section id="style_def_shortname">
<title>SHORTNAME</title>
<para>
   A SHORTNAME is generally the waypoint name of the data being processed.  
   SHORTNAME maps directly to the GPSBabel variable ->shortname.  A SHORTNAME 
   is CHARACTER data and requires a character array printf conversion.
</para>
<para>
example:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">
   IFIELD SHORTNAME,"","%s"   # (write shortname in the output file)
</screen>
</section>

<section id="style_def_description">
<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para>
   A DESCRIPTION is generally a long description of the waypoint.  A 
   DESCRIPTION maps to the GPSBabel variable ->description and is otherwise 
   handled exactly like a SHORTNAME.
</para>
<para>
examples:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">
   IFIELD DESCRIPTION,"","%s" # (write description in the output file)
</screen>
</section>

<section id="style_def_notes">
<title>NOTES</title>
<para>
   NOTES are generally everything else about a waypoints. NOTES map to the 
   GPSBabel variable ->notes and is otherwise handled exactly like a 
   SHORTNAME.
</para>
</section>

<section id="style_def_url">
<title>URL</title>
<para>
   URL is a URL for the waypoint.  URL maps to the GPSBabel variable 
   ->url and is otherwise handled exactly like a SHORTNAME.
</para>
<para>
example:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">
   IFIELD URL,"","%s" #	(writes the URL in the output file)
</screen>
</section>

<section id="style_def_urllinktext">
<title>URL_LINK_TEXT</title>
<para>
   URL_LINK_TEXT is a textual description of where a URL points.  
   URL_LINK_TEXT maps to the GPSBabel variable ->url_link_text and 
   is otherwise handled exactly like a SHORTNAME.
</para>
<para>
example:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">
   IFIELD URL_LINK_TEXT,"","%s" # (writes link text in the output file)
</screen>
</section>

<section id="style_def_icondescr">
<title>ICON_DESCR</title>
<para>
   ICON_DESCR is a textual description of an icon type for a waypoint.
   ICON_DESCR maps to the GPSBabel variable ->icon_desc and is otherwise 
   handled exactly like a SHORTNAME.
</para>
<para>
example:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">
   IFIELD ICON_DESCR,"","%s" # (writes link text in the output file)
</screen>
</section>

<section id="style_def_latdec">
<title>LAT_DECIMAL</title>
<para>
   LAT_DECIMAL defines LATITUDE in DECIMAL format.  Note that this is a PURE 
   signed decimal format (i.e. -91.0000).  This data is handled internally as 
   a DOUBLE PRECISION FLOAT and requires a FLOATING POINT printf conversion.
</para>
<para>
example:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">
   IFIELD LAT_DECIMAL,"","%f"
</screen>
</section>


<section id="style_def_londec">

   See LAT_DECIMAL, except LON_DECIMAL defines LONGITUDE.
</para>
</section>

<section id="style_def_latint32">
<title>LAT_INT32DEG</title>
<para>
   LAT_INT32DEG defines LATITUDE in what I call INT32DEGREES.  This value is 
   a signed LONG INTEGER and requires a LONG INTEGER printf conversion.
   (This format is only used by some DeLorme products.)
</para>
<para>
example:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">

</para>
</section>

<section id="style_def_latdirdec">
<title>LAT_DECIMALDIR / LAT_DIRDECIMAL</title>
<para>
   LAT_DECIMALDIR and LAT_DIRDECIMAL  define LATITUDE in DECIMAL format 
   with the added bonus of a 'N/S' or 'E/W' direction character.  This data 
   is handled internally as a DOUBLE PRECISION FLOAT and a single 
   CHARACTER and requires a FLOATING POINT as well as a CHARACTER printf 
   conversion.  The only difference between the two is whether the directional
   character appears before (LAT_DIRDECIMAL) or after (LAT_DECIMALDIR) the
   decimal number.
</para>
<para>
examples:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">
   IFIELD LAT_DECIMALDIR,"","%f %c"     #  (writes 31.333 N)
   IFIELD LAT_DIRDECIMAL,"","%c %f"     #  (writes N 31.333)

</section>

<section id="style_def_londirdec">
<title>LON_DECIMALDIR / LON_DIRDECIMAL</title>

</section>

<section id="style_def_latlondir">
<title>LAT_DIR / LON_DIR</title>
<para>
   LAT_DIR returns the single character 'N' or 'S' depending on the 
   hemisphere of the latitude.  LON_DIR returns 'E' or 'W' depending on
   the hemisphere of the longitude.
</para>
</section>

<section id="style_def_lathuman">
<title>LAT_HUMAN_READABLE</title>
<para>
   LAT_HUMAN_READABLE defines LATITUDE in a human-readable format.  This 
   format is probably the most expressive format.  It is similar to 
   LAT_DECIMALDIR in that it requires multiple printf conversions, but it
   is far more flexible as to the contents of those conversions.  On read,
   the printf conversions are ignored and GPSBabel attempts to determine the
   latitude and longitude based on what is in the file.
</para>
<para>
examples:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">
   IFIELD LAT_HUMAN_READABLE,"","%c %d %f"   # (writes N 31 40.000)
   IFIELD LAT_HUMAN_READABLE,"","%d deg %f min %c"

<section id="style_def_latlonhuman">
<title>LATLON_HUMAN_READABLE</title>
<para>
   LATLON_HUMAN_READABLE is like LAT_HUMAN_READABLE and LON_HUMAN_READABLE
   except that it reads and writes both latitude and longitude as a single 
   field.  On write, the same format specifier is used for both coordinates.
   On read, GPSBabel does exactly the same thing it does for 
   LAT_HUMAN_READABLE or LON_HUMAN_READABLE.
</para>

   by Groundspeak.  A "three and a half star" cache would therefore be "3.5"

<section id="style_def_pathdistmi">
<title>PATH_DISTANCE_MILES</title>
<para>
   PATH_DISTANCE_MILES outputs the total length of the route or track from
   the start point to the current point, in miles.  This and the altitude
   could be used to create an elevation profile.  PATH_DISTANCE_MILES is
   a DOUBLE PRECISION FLOAT.
</para>
<para>
   PATH_DISTANCE_MILES is not valid as an input field.
</para>
<para>
   PATH_DISTANCE_MILES is only meaningful if the data comes from a track
   or a route; waypoint data will generate essentially meaningless output.
