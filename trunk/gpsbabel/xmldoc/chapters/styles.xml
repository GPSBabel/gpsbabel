<title>Introduction to GPSBabel Styles</title>
<para>
Often it is desirable to add a new file format for "one-off" work (perhaps
you want to export something to a spreadsheet or graphing program) or to read
a format that GPSBabel does not yet support.   For suitably simple formats,
this can be done by a user with no programming experience by providing a 
GPSBabel style file.
</para>
<para>
For a format to be described by a style file, it must be predictable and 
generally readable by humant.  Formats with binary or unreadable content 
are not good fits for this scheme.  It should have:
<simplelist>
<member>A fixed header at the beginning, if it has any at all. This is called a 'prologue'.</member>
<member>Waypoints that are grouped by fixed separators, often a newline.  In style file parlance, this is called a 'record'.</member>
<member>Traits of that waypoint described in that record.  In the style files, these are called 'fields' and examples may include longitude or a name.</member>
<member>Fields that are grouped by fixed separators, often a comma or a tab.  In the style files, this is called the field separator. Fields may be enclosed by characters, such as a double quote.</member>
<member>A fixed footer at the end, if it has any at all.  This is called the 'epilogue'.</member>
</simplelist>
</para>
<para>
Once you have created a style file that describes the file format you have
or want, you must tell GPSBabel to use the xcsv format and have the xcsv 
format use that file.  If you created a new style file called 
"mystyle.style" and you want to write the  waypoints from
a GPX file named "mine.gpx" to it, you would issue a command like:
</para>
<para><userinput>gpsbabel -i gpx -f mine.gpx -o xcsv,style=mystyle.style -F mine.new</userinput></para>
<para>
You might then examine <filename>mine.new</filename> to see if it met
your expectations.  If not, you could continue to tweak 
<filename>mystyle.style</filename> until it did, rerunning the above
command each time.  If 'mystyle' is a format 
that describes a popular program or is likely to be of use to others, you can
then share <filename>mystyle.style</filename> with other GPSBabel users.
Send it along with a coherent description to the GPSBabel-misc mailing 
list for consideration to be included in a future version.
</para>

<section id="style_intro2">
<title>Style file overview</title>
<para>
The first and foremost important step is understanding how the style
file is laid out itself.  The format is:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">DIRECTIVE&lt;whitespace&gt;VALUE</screen>
<para>
Where &lt;whitespace&gt; is one or more spaces or tabs.  There should
be no spaces or tabs at the beginning of the line; all directives start
at the left edge in column zero.
</para>

An example style format is shown here:

<title>Internal Constants</title>
<para>
A few internal constants are defined in the XCSV parser to make the style
file simpler.  They may or may not be used and are optional in most cases. 
Note that only certain style file directives map these constants.

<section id="style_const_whitespace">
<title>WHITESPACE</title>
<para>
The WHITESPACE constant has special properties.  When reading data, 
WHITESPACE refers to sequential runs of SPACES and/or TABS.  When
writing data, WHITESPACE is always a single SPACE.
</para>
<para>
For example, the following line:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">SOME_NAME       30.1208 -91.1365    SOME OTHER NAME
</screen>
<para>
Parses into the following data fields:

<section id="style_behavior">
<title>GPSBabel Behavior Directives</title>
<para>
There are a few available directives to control some of the internal 
processing functions of GPSbabel.
</para>
<section id="style_behave_shortlen">
<title>SHORTLEN</title>
<para>
   This sets the maximum allowed shortname length when using the internal
   shortname synthesizer.
</para>
<para>
   example:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">   SHORTLEN	16	# shortnames will be at most 16 characters long.
</screen>
</section>

<section id="style_behave_shortwhite">
<title>SHORTWHITE</title>
<para>
   This tells the shortname synthesizer whether or not to allow whitespace
   in the synthesized shortnames.  Allowed values are zero and one.
</para>

<section id="style_layout">
<title>Defining the Layout of the File</title>
<para>
The first few directives define the layout the physical file itself:
</para>

<section id="style_layout_field">
<title>FIELD_DELIMITER</title>
<para>
   The field delimiter defines the character(s) that separate the fields in 
   the rows of data inside the XCSV file.  Common field delimiters are commas 
   and tabs. (referred to as "comma separated values" and "tab separated 
   values")
</para>
<para>
   examples: 
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">   FIELD_DELIMITER    COMMA
   FIELD_DELIMITER    ~
</screen>
<para>
   The directive FIELD_DELIMITER is parsed for STYLE CONSTANTS as defined in 
   the table above.
</para>
</section>

<section id="style_layout_field_enclose">
<title>FIELD_ENCLOSER</title>
<para>
   The field encloser defines the character(s) that surround the field values.
   Common field enclosers are single and double quote marks. Many styles will
   leave this directive unset. If set, it will be applied to all fields.
</para>
<para>
   examples: 
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">   FIELD_ENCLOSER    DOUBLEQUOTE
   FIELD_ENCLOSER    SINGLEQUOTE
</screen>
<para>
   The directive FIELD_ENCLOSER is parsed for STYLE CONSTANTS as defined in 
   the table above.
</para>
</section>

<section id="style_layout_rec">
<title>RECORD_DELIMITER</title>
<para>
   The record delimiter defines that character(s) that separate ROWS of 
   data (FIELDS) in the XCSV file.  The most common record delimiters
   are NEWLINE and CR (carriage return).
</para>
<para>
   examples:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">   RECORD_DELIMITER    NEWLINE
   RECORD_DELIMITER    |
</screen>
<para>
   The directive RECORD_DELIMITER is parsed for STYLE CONSTANTS as defined 
   in the table above.
</para>
</section>

<section id="style_layout_badchars">
<title>BADCHARS</title>
<para>   
   Bad characters are things that should *never* be written into the XCSV
   file as data on output.  GPSBabel automatically includes any non-blank
   FIELD_DELIMITER and FIELD_ENCLOSER and RECORD_DELIMITER characters as
   BADCHARS by default.
</para>
<para>
   examples: 
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">  BADCHARS    COMMA
  BADCHARS    ~|
</screen>
<para>
   The directive BADCHARS is parsed for STYLE CONSTANTS as defined in the 
   table above.
</para>
</section>

<section id="style_layout_prologue">
<title>PROLOGUE</title>
<para>
   A prologue is basically constant data that is written to the output
   file BEFORE any waypoints are processed.  PROLOGUE can be defined 
   multiple times in the style file, once for each "line" before the data 
   begins.  This is commonly used in XCSV files as a "header" row.  
</para>
<para>
   examples: 
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">  PROLOGUE	OziExplorer Waypoint File Version 1.1
  PROLOGUE	WGS 84
  PROLOGUE	Symbol,Name,Latitude,Longitude
</screen>
</section>

<section id="style_layout_epilogue">
<title>EPILOGUE</title>
<para>
   An Epilogue is the same as a prologue, except this data is written at 
   the END of the file.  See the examples for PROLOGUE above.
</para>
</section>
</section> <!-- layout -->

<section id="style_define">
<title>Defining Fields Within the File</title>
<para>
A field defines data.  There are two different classifications of FIELDS,
IFIELD (file input) and OFIELD (file output).  In the absence of any OFIELDS,
IFIELDS are use as both input and output.  The existence of OFIELDS is 
primarily to allow more flexible mapping of GPSBabel data to output data 
(say, for instance, to map the internal GPSBabel "description" variable to 
two or more fields on output).  For all practical purposes, IFIELDS and 
OFIELDS are defined the same way in the style file.</para>
<para>The following per-field options are defined:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
   "no_delim_before" is supported on in OFIELD tags to specify that this
   field should be written without a field delimiter before it.  It's
   useful for limited field concatenation.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
   "absolute" is supported on OFIELD tags for lat and lon to indicate
   that only absolute values (never negative) are to be printed.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
   "optional" is supported only OFIELD tags and indicates that the
   field may or may not be available in the source data.  If the
   field is absent, no trailing field separator is written.
</para>
<para>
   This attribute is most useful when paired with "no_delim_before" as
   it allows you to concatenate fields without concern for whether those
   fields are actually populated or not.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>
There are several different types of fields that may be defined.  Each field 
consists of three pieces of information: the FIELD TYPE, a DEFAULT VALUE, and 
a PRINTF CONVERSION (for output).  In many cases, not all pieces are used,
but all 3 pieces are required.   Additionally, an fourth field is supported
that modifies the behaviour of the field being described.
</para>
<para>
FIELDS should be defined in the style file in the logical order that they
appear in the data, from left to right.  This is the order in which they are
parsed from input and written to output.
</para>
<para>
The fields used by the XCSV parser are as follows:
</para>

<section id="style_def_ignore">
<title>IGNORE</title>
<para>
   IGNORE fields are, guess what, ignored on input.   Internally, IGNORE 
   fields are treated as CHARACTER data, and as such, require a printf 
   conversion for a character array.  
</para>
<para>
examples:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">   IFIELD IGNORE,"","%14.14s"   # (writes a 14 character blank field)
   IFIELD IGNORE,"","%s"        # (writes a blank field on output)
</screen>
</section>

<section id="style_def_constant">
<title>CONSTANT</title>
<para>
   CONSTANT fields are, of course, constant.  They are ignored on input, 
   however they write CONSTANT data on output.  As such, they require a 
   DEFAULT VALUE and a printf conversion for a character array. 
</para>
<para>
examples:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">   IFIELD CONSTANT,"FFFFFF","%s"   # (writes "FFFFFF" in the field)
   IFIELD CONSTANT,"01/01/70","%s" # (a constant date field)
</screen>
</section>

<section id="style_def_index">
<title>INDEX</title>
<para>
   An INDEX field is used ONLY on output.  The INDEX constant defines a field 
   that, at output, contains the sequence number of the waypoint being 
   written, starting at 0.  An index is managed internally as an INTEGER 
   and requires an INTEGER printf conversion.  An INDEX has one special
   property.  The DEFAULT VALUE of the index is added to the index 
   on each iteration (to allow indexes starting at 1, 100, etc..).   
</para>
<para>
examples:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">   IFIELD INDEX,"0","%04d"     # (Starts counting at zero)
   IFIELD INDEX,"","%04d"      # (Starts counting at zero)
   IFIELD INDEX,"1","%04d"     # (Starts counting at one)
</screen>
</section>

<section id="style_def_shortname">
<title>SHORTNAME</title>
<para>
   A SHORTNAME is generally the waypoint name of the data being processed.  
   SHORTNAME maps directly to the GPSBabel variable ->shortname.  A SHORTNAME 
   is CHARACTER data and requires a character array printf conversion.
</para>
<para>
example:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">   IFIELD SHORTNAME,"","%s"
</screen>
</section>

<section id="style_def_description">
<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para>
   A DESCRIPTION is generally a long description of the waypoint.  A 
   DESCRIPTION maps to the GPSBabel variable ->description and is otherwise 
   handled exactly like a SHORTNAME.
</para>
<para>
examples:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">   IFIELD DESCRIPTION,"","%s" 
</screen>
</section>

<section id="style_def_notes">
<title>NOTES</title>
<para>
   NOTES are generally everything else about a waypoints. NOTES map to the 
   GPSBabel variable ->notes and is otherwise handled exactly like a 
   SHORTNAME.
</para>
</section>

<section id="style_def_url">
<title>URL</title>
<para>
   URL is a URL for the waypoint.  URL maps to the GPSBabel variable 
   ->url and is otherwise handled exactly like a SHORTNAME.
</para>
<para>
example:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">   IFIELD URL,"","%s"
</screen>
</section>

<section id="style_def_urllinktext">
<title>URL_LINK_TEXT</title>
<para>
   URL_LINK_TEXT is a textual description of where a URL points.  
   URL_LINK_TEXT maps to the GPSBabel variable ->url_link_text and 
   is otherwise handled exactly like a SHORTNAME.
</para>
<para>
example:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">   IFIELD URL_LINK_TEXT,"","%s" 
</screen>
</section>

<section id="style_def_icondescr">
<title>ICON_DESCR</title>
<para>
   ICON_DESCR is a textual description of an icon type for a waypoint.
   ICON_DESCR maps to the GPSBabel variable ->icon_desc and is otherwise 
   handled exactly like a SHORTNAME.
</para>
<para>
example:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">   IFIELD ICON_DESCR,"","%s" 
</screen>
</section>

<section id="style_def_latdec">
<title>LAT_DECIMAL</title>
<para>
   LAT_DECIMAL defines LATITUDE in DECIMAL format.  Note that this is a PURE 
   signed decimal format (i.e. -91.0000).  This data is handled internally as 
   a DOUBLE PRECISION FLOAT and requires a FLOATING POINT printf conversion.
</para>
<para>
example:
</para>
<screen format="linespecific">   IFIELD LAT_DECIMAL,"","%f"

</section>

<section id="style_def_latint32">
<title>LAT_INT32DEG</title>
<para>
   LAT_INT32DEG defines LATITUDE in what I call INT32DEGREES.  This value is 
   a signed LONG INTEGER and requires a LONG INTEGER printf conversion.
   (This format is only used by some DeLorme products.)
</para>

<section id="style_def_latdirdec">
<title>LAT_DECIMALDIR / LAT_DIRDECIMAL</title>
<para>
   LAT_DECIMALDIR and LAT_DIRDECIMAL  define LATITUDE in DECIMAL format 
   with the added bonus of a 'N/S' or 'E/W' direction character.  This data 
   is handled internally as a DOUBLE PRECISION FLOAT and a single 
   CHARACTER and requires a FLOATING POINT as well as a CHARACTER printf 
   conversion.  The only difference between the two is whether the directional
   character appears before (LAT_DIRDECIMAL) or after (LAT_DECIMALDIR) the
   decimal number.
</para>
<para>
examples:

<section id="style_def_lathuman">
<title>LAT_HUMAN_READABLE</title>
<para>
   LAT_HUMAN_READABLE defines LATITUDE in a human-readable format.  This 
   format is probably the most expressive format.  It is similar to 
   LAT_DECIMALDIR in that it requires multiple printf conversions, but it
   is far more flexible as to the contents of those conversions.  On read,
   the printf conversions are ignored and GPSBabel attempts to determine the
   latitude and longitude based on what is in the file.

<para>
   LATLON_HUMAN_READABLE is like LAT_HUMAN_READABLE and LON_HUMAN_READABLE
   except that it reads and writes both latitude and longitude as a single
