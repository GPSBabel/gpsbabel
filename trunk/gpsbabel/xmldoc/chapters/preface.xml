         <title>The Problem: Too many incompatible formats</title>
         <para> There are simply too many gratuitously different file formats
to hold waypoint, track, and route information in various programs
used by computers and GPS receivers.  
<ulink url="http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp">GPX</ulink>  defines a
standard in XML to contain all the data, but there are too many
programs that don't understand it yet and too much data that are in an
alternate formats.
</para>
<para>
Perhaps you have an Explorist 600 and your friend has a StreetPilot 2720.
You've collected a a list of your favorite locations as waypoints and you'd
like to be able to share them.  Unfortunately, his copy of Garmin Mapsource
won't read data created by your copy of Magellan Directroute.  What you need
is a program that converts data bewteen the two programs.

But GPSBabel actually does much more...

         <title>The Solution</title>
         <para> The original author of GPSBabel, <ulink url="/people/robertlipe.html">Robert Lipe</ulink>, needed to convert waypoints between a couple of formats, so he
whipped up a converter and based it on an extensible foundation so
that it was easy to add new formats and made the program freely available. <ulink url="/people/index.html">Many others</ulink> have contributed to the program since then.</para>
	<para>  Most file formats added so far have taken under 200 
	lines of reasonable ISO C so they can be stamped
	out pretty trivially.  Formats that are ASCII text delimited in some
	fixed way can be added with no programming at all via our 
	<link linkend="Styles">style</link> mechanism.
