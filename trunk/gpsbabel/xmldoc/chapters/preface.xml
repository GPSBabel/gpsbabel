         <para> There are simply too many gratuitously different file formats
to hold waypoint, track, and route information in various programs
used by computers and GPS receivers.  
<ulink url="http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp">GPX</ulink>  defines a
standard in XML to contain all the data, but there are too many
programs that don't understand it yet and too much data that are in an
alternate formats.

         <para> The original author of GPSBabel, <ulink url="/people/robertlipe.html">Robert Lipe</ulink>, needed to convert waypoints between a couple of formats, so he
whipped up a converter and based it on an extensible foundation so
that it was easy to add new formats and made the program freely available. <ulink url="/people/index.html">Many others</ulink> have contributed to the program since then.</para>
	<para>  Most file formats added so far have taken under 200 
	lines of reasonable ISO C so they can be stamped
	out pretty trivially.  Formats that are ASCII text delimited in some
	fixed way can be added with no programming at all via our 
	<link linkend ="Styles">style</link> mechanism.
