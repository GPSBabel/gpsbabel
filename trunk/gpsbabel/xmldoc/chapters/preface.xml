         <para> There are simply too many gratuitously different file formats
to hold waypoint, track, and route information in various programs
used by computers.  GPX (http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp) defines a
standard in XML to contain all the data, but there are too many
programs that don't understand it yet and too much data that are in an
alternate formats.

         <para> I needed to convert waypoints between a couple of formats, so I
whipped up a converter and based it on an extensible foundation so
that it was easy to add new formats.  Most file formats added so far
have taken under 200 lines of reasonable ISO C so they can be stamped
out pretty trivially.  Formats that are ASCII text delimited in some
fixed way can be added with no programming at all via our 'style'
mechanism.
