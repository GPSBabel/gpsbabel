      <para> GPSBabel is distributed in source format that will work on
about any operating system and as ready-to-run binaries for some
operating systems, notably Windows.  See the "OS-Specific notes" at
<ulink url="http://www.gpsbabel.org ">gpsbabel.org</ulink> for
instructions on those binary kits.
</para>
      <para> For operating systems where no binary is provided, you will
have to build it.  The code should be compilable on any system with
ISO C89 compilers.  It's been tested on UnixWare, OpenServer, OS/X,
Linux, Solaris, and a variety of processors and compilers.
</para>
      <para> Libexpat is required for source builds.  If you get errors
about expat.h being missing, you must either edit the Makefile to tell
the compiler where it is or install it in a sensible place.  Expat can
be downloaded from <ulink url="http://expat.sourceforge.net">http://expat.sourceforge.net</ulink> and is part of Apache so it's very portable.
