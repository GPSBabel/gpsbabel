  <para> 
GPSBabel is distributed "ready to run" on most common 
operating systems via the 
<ulink url="http://www.gpsbabel.org/download.html">download page</ulink>.
</para>
  <para> As GPSBabel runs on a wide variety of operating systems,
be sure to visit the 
<ulink url="http://www.gpsbabel.org/osnotes.html">OS-Specific notes</ulink> for
additional information.

<title>Building from source.</title>
  <para> 
 For operating systems where no binary is provided or if 
you want the latest development version, you will have to build it from
source.  The code should be compilable on any system with
ISO C89 compilers.  It's been tested on UnixWare, OpenServer, OS/X,
Linux, Solaris, and a variety of processors and compilers.
</para>
<para>
You can grab a release from the <ulink url="http://www.gpsbabel.org/download.html">GPSBabel download page</ulink>, but if you're going to be doing any development, you'll find that working from the <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=58972">GPSBabel CVS tree</ulink> is easier.
</para>
  <para>
  In most cases, the code is as simple to build as running:
</para>
<para><userinput> ./configure &amp;&amp; make</userinput></para>
  <para><ulink url="http://expat.sourceforge.net">Expat</ulink> 
is strongly recommended for source builds as it is
required for reading all the XML formats such as GPX.  Fedora users
may need to 'yum install expat-devel'.  Ubuntu users may need to 
'apt-get install expat libexpat-dev'.
</para>
  <para><ulink url="http://libusb.sourceforge.net">libusb</ulink> 
is recommended for OS/X and Linux if you want to use a USB Garmin.
Fedora users may need to 'yum install libusb-devel'.  Ubuntu users may
need to 'apt-get install libusb-dev'.
</para>
<para>There are additional flags that can be passed to configure to
 customize your build of GPSBabel.   
</para>
<para><userinput>./configure --help</userinput></para> 
<para>
lists all the supported options, but of interest we have:</para><para>
 <option>--disable-shapefile</option> Excludes the shapefile support.
</para>
<para>
 <option>--disable-pdb</option> Excludes the Palm database support and all formats that rely on it.
</para>
<para>
  <option>--disable-csv</option> Excludes all support for our something-separated formats.
</para>
<para>
  <option>--disable-filters</option> Excludes all filter support.
</para>
<para>
  <option>--enable-efence</option> Activate debugging mode for gpsbabel-debug.
</para>
<para>
  <option>--with-doc=</option><filename class="directory">dir</filename> Specifies that the doc should be created and installed in <filename class="directory">dir</filename>.
</para>
<para>
  <option>--without-libusb</option> Disables use of libusb, even it's it's available.
</para>
<para>
 <option>--with-zlib=(included)|system|no</option> By default, we use our own version of zlib. If you specify <option>system</option> the system zlib is used.  A value of <option>no</option> (or --without-zlib) disables zlib.
