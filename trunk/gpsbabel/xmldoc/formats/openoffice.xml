format.  Intended to serve as source for number-processing
applications like OpenOffice, Ploticus and others. Tab was chosen as
delimiter because it is a) supported by both OpenOffice and Ploticus
and b) is not ',', so you can use <command moreinfo="none">sed -i
"s/./,/g" &lt;x&gt;.csv'</command> to adapt it to locales where ',' is
used as decimal seperator.  Contributed by Tobias Minich.</para>
