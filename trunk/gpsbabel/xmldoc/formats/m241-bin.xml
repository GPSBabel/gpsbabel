	The Holux m241 is a small datalogger using the MTK chipset, with 
	a couple small differences in the binary format. In its default 
	configuration, it can store ~100000 trackpoints with very limited

	source software 
         <ulink url="http://bt747.wiki.sourceforge.net">bt747</ulink>

	Holux GPSport 245 is a datalogger with display suitable for cycling, walking and running. 
        It can store ~200k trackpoints with limited data. The m241 and m241-bin format is 
        able to automatically detect GPSport 245 data and handle the differences from Holux M-241 devices.
        Note: GP245 does not log any quality of the position.
