on POSIX- compliant OSes like UNIX and Linux.  Reads and writes of
this format are very reliable.  (<ulink url="/people/robertlipe.html">The lead

	Note that 'gpsutil' is a different format - and program - than the one called <ulink url="http://www.gpsu.co.uk/index.html">GPS Utility</ulink>; for that one, you should probably use our  <link linkend="fmt_pcx">PCX module</link>.
