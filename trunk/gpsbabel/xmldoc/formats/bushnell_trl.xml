This format supports tracks from

receivers, notably the <productname>Onix 400</productname>.
</para>
<para>
This format reads individual .trl files as written by the GPS.  As this is
a reverse-engineered format, it's not understood how (or even if) long 
tracks, in 
particular, span multiple files so initially this format is most effective
on tracks under a few thousand points.
</para>
<para>
  When writing tracks, a maximum of 4502 points is supported as this is the
  most we believe these units can represent in a track.
</para>
<para>
  The output base filename, converted to uppercase and stripped of 
  everything but letters and digits, is used for the trail name inside 
  the file itself.
