This 1/0 option, defaulting to  if not provided, tells GPSBabel to 
use its own logic when sending data it can deduce is a geocache to 
the device. If false, any icon data present in the source data will
 be used instead. If you've taken control of the icon data, you are
 responsible for providing valid icons; GPSBabel will make no attempt 
to purify what gets sent.
