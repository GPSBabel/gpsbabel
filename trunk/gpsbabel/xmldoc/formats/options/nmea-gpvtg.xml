This option tells GPSBabel whether to read (on input) or write (on output) 
GPVTG sentences.  The default is to read or write GPVTG sentences.  To 
disable GPVTG sentences, specify <option>gpvtg=0</option>.

<para>
GPVTG sentences contain information about the heading and the speed at the
time of the fix.  They do not contain any location information; for that 
you will need either or both of GPGGA or GPRMC.
