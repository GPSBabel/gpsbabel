<para>
   This value specifies the grid to be used on write. It is similar to
   the grid option of garmin_txt (see <xref linkend="garmin_grid" />). The only difference is that unicsv does not
   write a degree sign (Â°) into the output file.
</para>
<para>
   Without this option unicsv writes the coordinates as simple numbers like in the samples above.
