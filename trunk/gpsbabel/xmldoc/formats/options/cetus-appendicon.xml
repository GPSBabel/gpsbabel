<para>
This option will add the icon description to the end of the waypoint
description on output.  This can be useful if the icon is used to convey
important information about the waypoint.  For example, the icon might be 
"found geocache" or "unfound geocache"; it might be useful to know that when
looking at a list of icons in Cetus.
