  Garmin units seems to use the creation timestamp of GPI files for internal jobs. 
  In other words,  if you load GPI files with same creation timestamp on your device, 
  strange things will happen (missing or repeated POIs). With sleep GPSbabel waits a given
  number of seconds after the GPI file was written.

  In normal case, when using GPSBabel from commandline or from the GUI, the chance to get files
  with same timestamp is in the nearly ZERO. In scripts or batch files this looks quiet other.
  Here we suggess the use of the sleep option. Values can be 1 (second) or more.
