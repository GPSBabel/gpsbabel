  The Garmin units seem to use the creation timestamp of GPI files for internal purposes. 
  In other words,  if you load GPI files with same creation timestamp on your device, 
  strange things will happen,  such as having missing or repeated POIs. With the sleep option, GPSBabel waits a given
  number of seconds after the GPI file was written.

  In the normal case of using GPSBabel from the command line or from the GUI, the chance of creating files
  with the same timestamp is in the nearly ZERO. In scripts or batch files where you are writing multiple files - even from different GPSBabel instances - the odds of this happening is rather good.
  The sleep option forces GPSBabel to wait after creating a file to ensure the timestamps are unique. Values are specified in seconds and can be 1 or more.
