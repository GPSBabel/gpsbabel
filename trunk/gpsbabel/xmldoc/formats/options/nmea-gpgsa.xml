This option tells GPSBabel whether to read (on input) or write (on output) 
GPGSA sentences.  The default is to read or write GPGSA sentences.  To 
disable GPGSA sentences, specify <option>gpgsa=0</option>.

<para>
GPGSA sentences contain information on the quality of the positional fix
and the individual satellites from which it was derived.  However, GPSBabel
neither reads nor writes the individual satellite data.  On input, the 
satellite fields are ignored and on output they are left blank.
