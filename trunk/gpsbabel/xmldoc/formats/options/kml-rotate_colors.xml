With this option GPSBabel uses different colors for each track or route.
If this option is used without a value then the colors are automatically selected such
that the spectrum will be rotated through once for all the tracks and once for all the routes.
If this option is used with a positive value then the value is interpreted as the number of degrees
in the color circle between adjacent tracks or routes. 
This option takes precedence over line_color.
