<para>
If you are creating a road layer, you may use the "road" option, which 
allows you to change the types of roads based on their names.  You can 
change multiple roads at the same time.  Currently supported types are

<para>
GPSBabel defaults to creating editable roads.  These are routed just like 
local roads, but may be edited with the drawing tools in Street Atlas.
</para>

<para> 
This option has a special format that is best demonstrated by example:
</para>

<screen format="linespecific"> "road=I-599!limited!Beecher St.!major" </screen>

<para>
This option will cause any road named "I-599" to become a limited-access 
highway and any road named "Beecher St." to become a major connector.  Note 
that roads that have had their types changed in this way are not editable 
in Street Atlas, so make sure they are where you want them before you 
change them, and make sure to keep a backup of your original road layer.  
Note that the ! is a shell metacharacter in bash and possibly other shells, 
so you may have to use single quotes or some other escape mechanism.
