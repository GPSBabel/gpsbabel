  This option is experimental and was added to solve a very specific problem.
  Certain Garmin units (the original black and white Vista is known to have 
  this) will sometimes scramble their clock crazy far into the future (like
  2066).  When this happens, the GPS itself may or may not work and 
  later conversations with GPSBabel may fail as the time overflows the
  documented range.  The use of <option>resettime</option> brings the GPS's internal clock
  back close enough to reality that the GPS itself can then "fix" it when
  it has next a lock.
