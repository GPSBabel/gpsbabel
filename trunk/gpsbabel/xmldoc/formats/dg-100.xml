  While the DG-100 has a button to record waypoints, they seem to be indistinguishable 
  from trackpoints. Therefore, all points will be presented as trackpoints, 
  regardless of whether they were recorded automatically or manually.

  The DG-100 provides a physical USB interface to the host computer, but
  internally it uses a Prolific PL-2303 chip to do this.  So you must have
  drivers installed on your computer to recognize the PL-2303 and provide
  that data as a serial port to software like GPSBabel.   Such software
  comes with the unit for Windows.  Prolific provides software for Mac OS/X,
  but unfortunately their driver has a defect which makes it unstable with
  GPSBabel.
