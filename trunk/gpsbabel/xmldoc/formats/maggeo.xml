500, 600, 210, and XL to describe geocaches.  Notice what while the format can
hold an infinite number of geocaches, the unit will read and silently
discard all but 200 geocache POIs at a time.</para>
      <para> You should name any file created with this format with a
".gs" extension so the firmware can read it.
