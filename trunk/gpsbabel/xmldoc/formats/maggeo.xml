<para> 
  This format supports the on-card format used by the 
  <ulink url="http://www.magellangps.com">Magellan</ulink> Explorist 400,
  Explorist 500, Explorist 600, Explorist 210, and Explorist XL 
  to describe geocaches.  Notice what while the format can
  hold an infinite number of geocaches, the unit will read and silently
  discard all but 200 geocache POIs at a time.</para>
<para>
  You should name any file created with this format with a ".gs" extension 
  so the firmware can read it.
</para>
<para>
  This format does support reading .gs files, but it's kind of a 
  pointless operation as the units can't create or edit these files.  
  Round-tripped data is lossy for all but the most trivial cases as
  many fields are shortened or discarded on write.  "Date last found" is
  discarded on read as there are no logs stored on the device in which to
  store the date last found.
