	The Holux m241 is a small datalogger using the MTK chipset, with 
	a couple small differences in the binary format. In its default 
	configuration, it can store ~100000 trackpoints with very limited
	 data; to configure extended logging you can use the BT747 open 
	source software 
         <ulink url="http://bt747.wiki.sourceforge.net">bt747</ulink>
	 Waypoint storage is possible only if "recording reason" (RCR) is enabled in the settings.
