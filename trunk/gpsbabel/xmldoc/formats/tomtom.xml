as used by the TomTom GO and TomTom Navigator.  It has been tested
with an original TomTom GO running version 5.00 of the TomTom
software.  There may be some records that confuse the input module -
if you have an example of such a record "in the wild", and you aren't
restricted from sharing it, we encourage you to post to the
gpsbabel-misc mailing list to contact a developer.</para>
      <para> Note that in addition to the .ov2 file, you will need a
.bmp file for the icon.  It should be 22x22 and 16 colors, and have
the same name (not including the extension) as the .ov2 file.
