   The format garmin_gpi supports binary POI (.gpi) files useable
   on newer Garmin GPS receivers (see also <link linkend="fmt_garmin_poi">garmin_poi</link> for some hints).
   <ulink url="http://www.garmin.com/support/agree.jsp?id=927">Garmin POI-Loader</ulink> is the standard application that creates GPI's
   with all possible features.

   The layout of GPI files isn't documented and our module was created
   via reverse engeneering. If you get a problem on reading or writing 
   a GPI file, please provide that file (mailto:gpsbabel-misc@lists.sourceforge.net).

   At this time we don't support special features as "Tour-Guide", alerts or links
   to sounds and pictures.
