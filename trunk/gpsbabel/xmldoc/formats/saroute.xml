and reads the anr, rte, and rtd formats as either tracks or
routes.</para>
      <para> The 'turns_only' option causes GPSBabel to read only the
waypoints associated with named turns.  This should create a list of
waypoints that correspond to the itinerary from Street Atlas.</para>
      <para> The 'turns_important' option only makes sense in
conjunction with the 'simplify' filter.  It ensures that the route
simplification process will remove the points corresponding to turns
only after it has removed all other route points.
</para>
      <para>The 'split' option causes GPSBabel to create separate
routes for each street, creating a new route at each turn point.  For
obvious reasons, 'split' cannot be used at the same time as the
'turns_only' or 'turns_important' options.</para>
      <para>The 'controls' option lets you read the control points
(start, end, vias, and stops) for your route as well as the route
itself.  The default for this option is 'none', which won't read the
control points.  You may also specify 'waypoints', which reads the
control points as waypoints, or 'route', which creates an extra route
named 'control points' containing just the control points in order.
Note that if your goal is to create an arc or other CSV file, you
should use 'none' (or not use this option, which is the same
thing.)</para>
      <para>The 'times' option causes GPSBabel to read the route as if
it were a track, synthesizing times starting from the current time, using
the estimated travel times specified in your route file (you can change your
travel speeds in the DeLorme product you used to create the route file.)</para>
      <para> All options only apply to route files from newer (anr)
versions of DeLorme software; older versions didn't store the turn
information with the route.
