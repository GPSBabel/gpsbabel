    <para>Mac OS/X is not supported.  We need to figure out the codeless 
  	kext thing to keep the OS from claiming this as a HID, which is 
	the interface it presents to the host OS.</para>

  This module implements the (undocumented) waypoint extensions introduced
  in firmware version 2.5 for enhanced geocaching mode.  As these are reverse
  engineered, there may be issues with those modes in particular.

<para>
	This format is used for both the serial protocol used on the
	devices with serial ports such as Map330 and Meridian and for
	the files stored either in either the unit's internal memory 
	(Explorist 210, Explorist 400, Explorist 500, Explorist 600, 
	Explorist XL) or on removable memory.
</para> 
<para>
	If you specify a serial port for the file (.e.g. "COM1", "/dev/ttyS0")
	to be read or written, GPSBabel will use serial protocol.   Specifying
	a file, either on local filesystem or on a mounted flash card reader,
	will results in the file-based format being used.
