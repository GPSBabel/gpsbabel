      Not all strains of Linux are supported.   Fedora 7 is known not to work, for example.

<para>
  Only the 'usb:' device is supported.  If you're on Windows, do not attempt to
  run this through the serial driver.

<para>
  On Linux, a name of the form 'hid:path-to-hidraw,path-to-hiddev' is also supported.
  You will need to use this only if the HID device nodes on your system are not named
  /dev/hidrawN and /dev/hiddevN or /dev/usb/hiddevN.

  This module implements the (undocumented) waypoint extensions introduced
  for enhanced geocaching mode in 2.5 for PN-40 and 1.6 for PN-20.  As 
  these are reverse engineered, there may be issues with those modes 
  in particular.

  If you receive a message that the device is busy, especially on Windows,
  that could be because another program, likely Delorme's own, has the 
  device open even though it's not actively interacting with the GPS.   In 
  Topo 8, on the GPS tab, look for GPS Options.  Uncheck "Start GPS" and 
  "Automatically detect GPS".   Then just click the Exchange button when
  you're ready for Topo to interact with the GPS.  Other Delorme software may
  be similar.
</para>
<para>
  The GPS should not be in 'map exchange' mode.   When in that mode, it appears
  as a disk to the USB system, thus GPSBabel will be unable to find the GPS.
