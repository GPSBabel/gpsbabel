  On Linux, a name of the form 'hid:path-to-hidraw,path-to-hiddev' is also supported.
  You will need to use this only if the HID device nodes on your system are not named
  /dev/hidrawN and /dev/hiddevN or /dev/usb/hiddevN.

  This module implements the (undocumented) waypoint extensions introduced
  for enhanced geocaching mode in 2.5 for PN-40 and 1.6 for PN-20.  As 
  these are reverse engineered, there may be issues with those modes 
  in particular.
