Routenplaner 2002-..." by Map&amp;Guide. It is a route-onle
format. If you own a newer release (2005...) you can also use the XML
export and convert via <command moreinfo="none">gpsbabel ... -i tef
...</command> to your preferred format.  May be there are other
products from Map&amp;Guide using the format.
</para>
      <para> Coordinates are stored in Mercator format. The
calculation between this and our internal format can result in visible
differences.  Experience reports are welcome.</para>
      <para>	Options:</para>
      <para>
            <option>index</option> - If more then one route are
present in source data, with this option you can determine, which of
this should used for the output. The range is 1 to number routes in
input.  If you don't use this, only the first route will be converted.
</para>
      <para>
            <option>name</option> - Not every input format has a real
name for routes in their data. So you can give the route a nice
name.</para>
      <para>
            <option>radius</option> - Overwrites the default value of
6371000.0 meters for the earth radius. My be this can help to reduce
differences.</para>
