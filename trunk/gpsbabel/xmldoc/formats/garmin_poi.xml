  The <ulink url="http://www.garmin.com/support/agree.jsp?id=927">Garmin POI loader</ulink> 
  loads custom points of interest into certain models of
  Garmin GPS receivers.  (As of this writing, only the models introduced
  in 2005 and later are supported.  See Garmin's site for more info.)
  The garmin_poi format produces csv files that can be
  converted into POI files by Garmin's POI loader.

  This format was mostly useful when POI Loader couldn't read GPX and we
  couldn't write GPI.  See <link linkend="fmt_garmin_gpi">GPSBabel's GPI doc</link>.
