export format, used by Map&amp;Guide "Motorrad-Routenplaner 2005/06".
Another posibility to exchange data with this are the .bcr files,
which are supported by GPSbabel in both directions (see BCR).
               </para>
      <para>Via XML this software can only export routing data.  So we
don't support writing.  With the option "routevia" you can eliminate
calculated route points from tef source file.</para>
