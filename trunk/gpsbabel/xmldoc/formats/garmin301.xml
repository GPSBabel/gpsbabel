is most useful for exporting data from units that support heart rate
data such as
<productname>Garmin Forerunner 301</productname>,
<productname>Garmin Forerunner 305</productname>, and
<productname>Garmin Edge 305</productname>, and
to other programs
for analysis.   It's a simple comma delimited format that includes the
timestamp, 3D position information and heart rate so you can pull it
into a spreadsheet or graphing program. </para>
