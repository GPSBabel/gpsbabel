KML, the Keyhole Markup Language format, was used by Keyhole and is used by 
<ulink url="http://earth.google.com">Google Earth</ulink>.  
</para>
<para>There are concepts in KML that GPSBabel can't support very well on 
read because they don't map well into other programs.  For example, KML has
ideas of camera views and names and descriptions can have arbitrarily 
complicated HTML in them.   KML files may have tiered "Styles" which
can identify sizing info and URLs of associated icons.   Reading such
files with GPSBabel - even if your goal it to write it back out as KML - can often
have surprising results.  Simple files with waypoints and paths (which
GPSBabel represents internally as tracks) work fine.

Google Earth also uses GPSBabel internally for receiver communications
and several file format imports and exports.

In general, GPSBabel's KML writer is relatively strong.  GPSBabel handles simple KML on read fairly well, but if you're dealing with handcrafted KML that uses extensive features that have no analog in other formats like nested folders, ringgeometry, camera angles, and such, don't expect GPSBabel to do well with them on read.

  Google Earth 4.0 and later have a feature that can surprise users of this 
  format.   Earth's "time slider" feature controls what timestamped data
  gets displayed.  If you're using data that has timestampes (e.g. GPX 
  points that contain time or almost any track data) this will be important
  to you.  The time slider defaults to the far left position and fully closed.
  This means that only the first data point will be displayed.  You can
  tweak Earth's settings to "view-&gt;show time-&gt;never" or
  you can widen the time slider to show the range of data of interest.
