The <ulink url="http://www.lowrance.com">Lowrance iFinder GPS</ulink> series has the unique capability
to output its data to an MMC card.  The data is saved to the card as a
.USR file and can be read by your computer using a card reader.
Waypoints, routes, tracks are supported.  By default, Event marker
icons are converted to waypoints.  Symbols tend to get lost in the
translation.
