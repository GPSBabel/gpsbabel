to output its data to an MMC card.  The data is saved to the card as a
.USR file and can be read by your computer using a card reader.
Waypoints, routes, tracks are supported.  By default, Event marker
icons are converted to waypoints.  Symbols tend to get lost in the
translation.</para>
      <para> Additional options: ignoreicons - don't convert icons to
waypoints merge - (USR output) merge all tracks into a single track
with segments break - (USR input) break track segments into separate
tracks</para>
