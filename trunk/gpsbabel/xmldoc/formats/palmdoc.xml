generates a Palm Database (PDB) file suitable for use with programs
like CSpotRun, TealDoc, AportisDoc, Palm Reader, and others.  The
resulting file also contains bookmarks to make it easy to jump to a
particular waypoint.  To suppress the dashed lines between waypoints,
use the 'nosep' option.  To specify a name for the document, use the
'dbname' option. Use the 'encrypt' option to encrypt hints from
Groundspeak GPX files.  Use the 'logs' option to include Groundspeak
cache logs.  If you would like the generated bookmarks to start with
the short name for the waypoint, specify the 'bookmarks_short' option.
This is particularly useful when used in combination with the 'sort'
filter.

      <para> The following command line reads a GPX file with
Groundspeak extensions and writes a Palm document with encrypted hints
and logs:
