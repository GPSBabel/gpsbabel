<para>
	This is the SD card format used by the <ulink url="http://www.magellangps.com">Magellan</ulink> Explorist 400,
	Explorist 500, Explorist 600, and Explorist XL and internally on those devices plus the 
	Explorist 210.  Stored waypoints are identical to the <link linkend="fmt_magellan">Magellan SD format</link>
	used by Meridian, but the newer models allow longer waypoint names.  Routes are 
	subtly different.
</para>
<para> 	
	You should name any file containing waypoints created with 
	this format with a ".upt" extension so the firmware can read it.
	Similarly, routes should be named ".rte" and tracks should be
	named ".log".
