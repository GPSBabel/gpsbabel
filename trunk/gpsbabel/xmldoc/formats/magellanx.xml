	This is the SD card format used by the Magellan Explorist 400,
	500, 600, and XL and internally on those devices plus the 
	Explorist 210.  Waypoints are identical to the Magellan SD format 
	used by Meridian, but allows longer waypoint names.  Routes are 
	subtly different.

	You should name any file containing waypoints created with 
	this format with a ".upt" extension so the firmware can read it.
	Similarly, routes should be named ".rte" and tracks should be
	named ".log".
