This format supports reading and writing wayponts to

receivers, notably the <productname>Onix 400</productname>.

It's an oddity for many GPSBabel norms that this format requires each 
waypoint be in a separate file.   Our "output filename" argument, -F is 
modified to take an "output filename template".   The output filename
you specify will have a dash, and a sequentially increasing integer,
and the ".wpt" extension appended to it.

Consider the case where 'whatever.gpx' holds three waypoints.
<userinput>
  gpsbabel -i gpx -f whatever.gpx -o bushnell -F /Volumes/Bushnell/whatever
</userinput>
will result in "whatever-0.wpt", "whatever-1.wpt", and "whatever-2.wpt" being
credated in that directory.
