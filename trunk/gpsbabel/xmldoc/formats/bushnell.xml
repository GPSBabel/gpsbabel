This format supports reading and writing wayponts to

receivers, notably the <productname>Onix 400</productname>.

It's an oddity for many GPSBabel norms that this format requires each 
waypoint be in a separate file.   Our "output filename" argument, -F is 
modified to take an "output filename template".   The output filename
you specify will have a dash, and a sequentially increasing integer,
and the ".wpt" extension appended to it.  When the names are shown on
the GPS itself, the shortnames from the source format are used and not these
"made up" names.

Consider the case where 'whatever.gpx' holds three waypoints.
<userinput>
  gpsbabel -i gpx -f whatever.gpx -o bushnell -F /Volumes/Bushnell/WAYPOINT/whatever
</userinput>
will result in "whatever-0.wpt", "whatever-1.wpt", and "whatever-2.wpt" being
created in that directory.
Windows users may prefer the spelling:
<userinput>
  gpsbabel -i gpx -f whatever.gpx -o bushnell -F e:/WAYPOINT/whatever
</userinput>
</para>

<para>
At least for the 200CR, the directory name used by the device is "WAYPOINT"
in the root directory.  It's also worth mentioning that its USB Mass Storage
protocol appears to not work on (at least) Snow Leopard 10.6.2.  It's not 
known if other Onix models have a more compatible USB implementation.
