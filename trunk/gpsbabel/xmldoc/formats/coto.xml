track and marker (waypoint) files. It is currently unable to write
track files, so only marker files can be written. The marker
categories are written to and read from the icon description. The 'Not
Assigned' category leaves the icon description empty on read.
Currently geocache info is ignored.</para>

      <para>
            <option>zerocat</option> (output) - Name for the Palm 'Not
Assigned' category.  Defaults to 'Not Assigned'.
  </para>
      <para> There is also a debugging option called 'internals' which
takes a XCSV delimiter value. It writes some internal values
(distance, arc, x and y) of the cotoGPS track format to the notes
field.  URL: <ulink url="http://core.de/~coto/projects/cotogps/">core.de/~coto</ulink>
