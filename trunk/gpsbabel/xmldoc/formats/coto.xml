This format supports <productname>cotoGPS</productname>, a <productname>Palm</productname> GPS program. 
It can read both track and marker (waypoint) files. It is currently unable 
to write track files, so only marker files can be written. The marker
categories are written to and read from the icon description. The 'Not
Assigned' category leaves the icon description empty on read.
Currently geocache info is ignored.

<para> In addition to the documented options, this format also has a 
debugging option called <option>internals</option> which takes an XCSV 
delimiter value. It writes some internal values (distance, arc, x and y) 
of the cotoGPS track format to the notes field.
