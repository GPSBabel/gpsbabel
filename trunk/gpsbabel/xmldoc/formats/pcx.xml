      <para> Garmin documents only PCX5, an older format limited to
the lame NMEA six-character waypoint names that's treated as a
second-class citizen in current versions of MapSource.  In Mapsource,
use file-&gt;import to read these files.  If you name the files *.wpt,
Mapsource will find them more easily.
</para>
      <para> In general, you should prefer the "mapsource" file format
to this one.
</para>
    <para>This format has been extended to handle many - but not all - 
	files from <ulink url="http://www.gpsu.co.uk/index.html">GPS Utility</ulink>.  If you encounter something that GPSBabel does not handle well, use
the free version of GPSUtil to read it and save as something more common.
