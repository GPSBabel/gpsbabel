waypoints in the input file.  It supports a number of Geocaching GPX
extensions, as well as filters out potentially harmful HTML from the
input file while maintaining almost all of the source HTML formatting.
Use the 'stylesheet' option to specify a CSS stylesheet to be used
with the resulting HTML file.  Use the 'encrypt' option to encrypt
hints from Groundspeak GPX files.  Use the 'logs' option to include
Groundspeak cache logs.
