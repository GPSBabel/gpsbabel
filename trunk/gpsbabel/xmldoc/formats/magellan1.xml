315, 330, Meridian, and SportTrak family.  I expect it to work on any
modern Magellan unit.</para>
      <para> As of 08/30/02, GPSBabel can also read and write the
files that can be stuck on the SD memory cards with the Meridian
models.  Simply specify a file instead of a serial port.</para>
      <para> Communication errors are handled robustly and
verification of data is enabled.</para>
      <para> Additional suboptions: <parameter moreinfo="none">baud:</parameter> may be 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600,
19200, but must match receiver.</para>
