The default behavior when creating waypoints is to use the SSID for
the short name, and information about the access point for the
description.  When the SSID is not unique, is not available, or
consists of whitespace, a shortname is synthesized.  The snmac option
uses the MAC address for the shortname, and includes the unmodified
SSID in the description.  Different icons are assigned to encrypted,
non-encrypted, stealth, and non-stealth access points; these may be
changed with options. Import only.
