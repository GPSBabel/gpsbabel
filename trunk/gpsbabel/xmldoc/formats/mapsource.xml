various members of that product family.  Icon mapping is attempted
between different MapSource versions.  Altitude is supported, but
proximity and depth are not.  Naming files *.mps will allow
file-&gt;open in Mapsource to find the files more easily.  Versions 3,
4 and 5 of the Mapsource data format are handled automatically on
input and by default the output is version 5.  (Until 3/2004, it was
version 3, but since Mapsource updates are free, the convenience of
having modern icon sets outweighs the backward compatibility concern.
Users of other versions can either upgrade or specify the switches to
get get output in a compatible format.)  Waypoints, routes and
tracklogs are all handled, but maps sets are ignored.
