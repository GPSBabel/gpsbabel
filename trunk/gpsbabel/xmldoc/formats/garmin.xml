<para> 
	GPSBabel supports a wide variety of Garmin hardware via serial
	on most operating systems and USB on Windows, Linux, and OS X.
</para>

<para> 
	For serial models, be sure the GPS is set for "Garmin
	mode" in setup and that nothing else (PDA hotsync programs, gpsd,
	getty, pppd, etc.) is using the serial port.

<para>
	None of the GPSBabel developers has access to every model on that
	list, but we've received reports of success and/or have reasonable
	expectations that the above models work. If you succeed with
	a model that is not on that list, please send a message to the
	gpsbabel-misc mailing list with the details so that we may add it.
</para>

<para>
	Not every feature on every model is supported.  For example, 
	while we do extract data such as heart rate and temperature from
	tracks on the sporting models like Edge and Forerunner, GPSBabel
	is not a fitness program at its core and does not support features 
	like courses or calorie/fitness zone data.
</para>

<para> 
	To communicate with a unit serially, use the name of that
	serial port such as "COM1" or  "/dev/cu.serial".  
</para>
<para>
	To communicate via USB use "usb:" as the filename on all OSes.   
	Thus, to read the waypoints from a Garmin USB unit and write 
	them to a GPX file:

      <screen format="linespecific">gpsbabel -i garmin -f usb: -o gpx -F blah.gpx</screen>

</para>
<para>
	If you have multiple units attached via USB, you may provide 
	a unit number, with zero being the implied default.  So if you 
	have three USB models on your system, they can be addressed as 
	"usb:0", "usb:1", and "usb:2".  To get a list of recognized devices,
	specifiy a negative number such as:
</para>
	<screen format="linespecific">gpsbabel -i garmin -f usb:-1</screen>
 
<para> 
When reporting problems with the Garmin format, be sure to include
the full unit model, firmware version, and be prepared to offer
debugging dumps by adding "-D9" to the command line, like:
</para>

      <screen format="linespecific"> gpsbabel -D9 -i garmin -f usb: -o gpx -F blah.gpx</screen>

<para> 
Custom icons are supported on units that support that.
Neither GPSBabel nor your firmware know what is associated with any
given slot number.  They don't know that the picture you placed in the
first slot is a happy face, they only know they're in the lowest
numbered slot.  GPSBabel names the them consistently with Mapsource,
so they are named 'Custom 0' through 'Custom 511'.
