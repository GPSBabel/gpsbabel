  Input support for Microsoft AutoRoute 2002-2006 .axe files
  and Microsoft Streets and Trips .est files.  This is for reading routes
  created this program and is different than the <link linkend="fmt_s_and_t">
  s_and_t</link> format used for writing pushpins.</para><para>
  These files contains only routes. We can extract the coordinates and
  the names of the points within route. An export to this format will
  not be supported.
</para>

<para>
  Only the start, stops, and end points are stored in the 
  .est/.axe/.ptm files. Turn-by-turn route data is not stored in the 
  .est/.axe/.ptm files, and is recalculated by the Microsoft title each 
  time on opening the file. This means that the output of GPSBabel will 
  not contain turns needed for driving directions.
</para>
<para>
  One possible approach to achieve similar results is to 
  use the Streets and Trips drawing tools to trace a line over the 
  interesting parts of the route to capture intersections or key turns.
  GPSBabel will capture stops in the route and insert those as turns, so 
  adding stops at intersections can also improve the results when converting.
