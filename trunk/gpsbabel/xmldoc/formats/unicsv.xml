<para>
   Unicsv examines the first line of a file to determine the field
   order and field separator in that file.   It is thus read-only format.
</para>
<para>
   If the first line contains any tabs, the data lines are assumed
   to be tab separated.   Otherwise the fields are assumed to be
   separated by commas.
