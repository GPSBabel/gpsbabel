<para>
   Unicsv examines the first line of a file to determine the field
   order and field separator in that file.   It is thus read-only format.
</para>
<para>
   If the first line contains any tabs, the data lines are assumed
   to be tab separated.   Otherwise the fields are assumed to be
   separated by commas.

   The list of keywords include:

   Fuller spellings (i.e. "longitude") may be used. You can also
   use keywords with a whitespace instead of an underscore.

<para>
   A typical file may be:
   <screen format="linespecific">
     Name, Latitude, Longitude, Description

   </screen>
</para>
	
<para>
   On the output side unicsv writes fixed number of columns (waypoint index, latitude, longitude and shortname) followed by a variable
   column list depending on internal data.
</para>
<para>
   With at least ONE valid timestamp in data a unicsv output may look like that:
   <screen format="linespecific">
     No,Name,Latitude,Longitude,Description,Date,Time
     1,GCEBB,35.972033,-87.134700,Mountain Bike Heaven by susy1313,2003/06/29,09:00:00
