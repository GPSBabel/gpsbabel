	Unicsv examines the first line of a file to determine the field
	order and field separator in that file.   It is thus read-only format.
	</para>
	<para>
	If the first line contains any tabs, the data lines are assumed 
	to be tab separated.   Otherwise the fields are assumed to be 
	separated by commas.
	</para>
	<para>
	The list of keywords include "lat", "lon", "desc", "name", 
	"notes", "alt", "utm z", "utm n", "utm e", "utm c" and "url".   
	Fuller spellings (i.e. "longitude") may be used.
