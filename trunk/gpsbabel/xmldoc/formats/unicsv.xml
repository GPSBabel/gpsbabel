<para>
   Unicsv examines the first line of a file to determine the field
   order and field separator in that file.   On write, it tries to 
   figure out what data it has and writes headers and all the data it can.
</para>
<para>
   If the first line contains any tabs, the data lines are assumed
   to be tab separated.   Otherwise the fields are assumed to be
   separated by commas.

   We support some enhanced Garmin attributes. They are also available in 
   <link linkend="fmt_gpx">gpx</link>, <link linkend="fmt_gdb">gdb</link>,

   <link linkend="fmt_garmin_txt">garmin_txt</link>. These entities are currently 
   not visible in <productname>MapSource</productname> (6.12.4), but are NOT dropped  
   when working with GDB (version 3) or GPX files.

   Please note, that these do NOT provide a geocoding service; don't expect
	to "convert" a street address to a latitude and longitude.

   A typical file may be:

   On the output side unicsv writes fixed number of columns (waypoint index, latitude and longitude)
   followed by a variable column list depending on internal data.
</para>
<para>
   With at least ONE valid timestamp in data a unicsv output may look like that:
