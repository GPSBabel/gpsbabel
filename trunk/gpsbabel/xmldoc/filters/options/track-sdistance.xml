         <para> The input track will be split into several tracks
         if the distance between successive track points
         is greater than the distance given as a parameter.
         The distance must be numeric and can be in miles or kilometers,
         expressed as one of the character "k", or "m".
	If sdistance is given no parameters, this option has the same 
	effect as the split option without parameters. If there is more 
	than one track,
         use the pack option before before using this.</para>

         <para> For example, to split the track if the distance between
         points is greater than 100 meters, use this:</para>
         <para><userinput>
gpsbabel -t 
     -i gpx -f in.gpx 
     -x track,pack,sdistance=0.1k" 
     -o gpx -F out.gpx
</userinput></para>
        <para> The sdistance option can be combined with the split option.
        The track then will be split only if both time and distance
        interval exceeds the supplied values. This technique can be used to 
	filter out gaps from
        the tracklog.  The gap is kept only if the gps device is without
        signal for longer time than that given and during that time it moves 
	a distance over that given.
        This example splits the track
        if the device is without signal for at least 5 minutes
        and during this time moves more than 300 meters:</para>
        <para><userinput>
gpsbabel -t 
     -i gpx -f in.gpx 
     -x track,pack,sdistance=0.3k,split=5m 
     -o gpx -F out.gpx
</userinput></para>
