<para>
This option specifies the maximum allowable error that may be introduced
by removing a single point.  The value of this option is a distance, 
specified in miles by default.  You may also specify the distance in 
kilometers by adding a 'k' to the end of the number.
</para>
<para> 
How the error is determined depends on whether the <option>length</option>
or <option>crosstrack</option> method is used.  If you are using the length
method, the error is the change in the length of the route introduced by 
removing a point.  If you are using the crosstrack method, the error is the
distance from the point to the line that results if that point is removed.
