This option lets you configure how many digits GPSBabel uses for numbering generated route point names.

<para>
When GPSBabel creates route points during the transformation process these points are sequentially numbered and named "RPTxxx" where xxx represent the number. By default GPSBabel uses 3 digits for these numbers. Rationale: This way a large number of route points can be uniquely named while the generated names are limited to 6 characters. This limitation is imposed by specific GPS-devices.

<para>
Using this option GPSBabel can be configured to use less or more digits for the generated names. This option is best used in conjunction with the rptname option.
