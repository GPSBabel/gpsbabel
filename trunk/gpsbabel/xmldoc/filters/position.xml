         on their proximity to each other.  Distances can be passed on
         the command line by passing the <parameter moreinfo="none">distance=XXX</parameter> option to the
         filter.  Distance options may be expressed in feet
         (<parameter moreinfo="none">distance=3f</parameter>) or
         meters (<parameter moreinfo="none">distance=1m</parameter>).
         The default is zero feet, essentially a duplicate position.

         <para> would remove multiple points that are within 1 foot of
         each other, leaving just one.</para>
         <para> You can also specify the "all" option, which would
         remove all of the points rather than leaving one.</para>
