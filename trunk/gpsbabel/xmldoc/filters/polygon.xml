         of a polygon.  A polygon file looks like an arc file, except
         that the arc it describes must be a closed cycle.  That is,
         for a simple polygon, the first and last points must be the
         same.  Here's a square:

         <screen format="linespecific">
          # A square (not really) polygon
          41.0000       -85.0000
          41.0000       -86.0000
          42.0000       -86.0000
          42.0000       -85.0000
          41.0000       -85.0000
</screen>
         <para> Polygons may include islands and holes.  To specify an
         island or a hole, just append it to the main polygon.
</para>
         <para> As with the arc filter, you specify a polygon by
         specifying the name of the file that contains it, using
         the file option.  You can also specify the exclude option,
         which reverses the operation of the filter so that it only
         includes points that are NOT in the polygon.
</para>
         <para> Note that this filter currently will not work properly
         if your polygon contains one or both poles or if it spans the
         line of 180 degrees east or west longitude.
</para>
         <para> For example, assume you have a polygon file that
         defines the border of your county, called mycounty.txt.  This
         command line will give you only the points in your county:
</para>
         <screen format="linespecific">	gpsbabel -i geo -f 1.loc -x polygon,file=mycounty.txt  	  	 \
-o mapsend -F 2.wpt</screen>
