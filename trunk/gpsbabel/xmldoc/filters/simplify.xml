The Simplify filter is used to simplify routes and tracks for use with 
formats that limit the number of points they can contain or just to 
reduce the complexity of a route.
</para>
<para>
The filter attempts to remove points from each route until the number 
of points or the error is within the given bounds, while also attempting 
to preserve the shape of the original route as much as possible.  
</para>
<para> 
The quality of the results will vary depending on the density of points 
in the original route and the length of the original route.

For example, suppose you have a route from Street Atlas 2003 that you 
wish to use with a Magellan GPS receiver that only supports up to 50 points 
in a route:
