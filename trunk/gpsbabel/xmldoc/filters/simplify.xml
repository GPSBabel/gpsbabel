         tracks for use with formats that limit the number of points
         they can contain or just to reduce the complexity of a route.</para>
         <para>The Simplify filter attempts to remove points from each 
         route until the number of points or the error is within the given 
         bounds, while also attempting to preserve the shape of the original 
         route as much as possible.  </para>
         <para>You must specify either the "count" option or the "error" option.
         The count option requires a number, which is the maximum number
         of points that will appear in the simplified track.  The error 
         option takes a distance, optionally followed by an 'm' for miles or
         a 'k' for kilometers.  That distance specifies the maximum error;
         how that error is determined depends on the simplification method,
         described next.</para>
         <para>You may also specify the method by which the filter chooses
         which points to remove.  The options are "length", which tries to
         remove points that have the smallest effect on the overall length
         of the route, or "crosstrack", which tries to remove points that 
         have the smallest overall effect on the shape of the route.  The
         default, if you don't specify either option, is "crosstrack". </para>
         <para> The quality of the results will vary depending on the
         density of points in the original route and the length of the
         original route.</para>
         <para> For example, suppose you have a route from Street
         Atlas 2003 that you wish to use with a Magellan GPS receiver
         that only supports up to 50 points in a route:</para>
