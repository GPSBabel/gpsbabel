There are three main types of data that GPSBabel deals with:
waypoints, tracks, and routes.   The nuketypes filter allows
removing all the data of any or all of those three types.

<para>
If you have a GPX file that contains routes, tracks, and
waypoints and you want a GPX file that contains only tracks,
you may use this filter to remove the waypoints and the routes 
with this command:
</para>
<para><userinput>gpsbabel -i gpx -f bigfile.gpx -x nuketypes,waypoints,routes -o gpx -F tracksonly.gpx</userinput></para>
