	There are three main types of data that GPSBabel deals with:
	waypoints, tracks, and routes.   The nuketypes filter allows
	removing all the data of any or all of those three types.
	</para>
	<para><option>waypoints</option> - Removes all waypoints.</para>
	<para><option>tracks</option> - Removes all routes.</para>
	<para><option>routes</option> - Removes all routes.</para>
	<para>
	For example, if you have a GPX file that contains routes, tracks, and
	waypoints and you want a GPX file that contains only tracks,
	you can use this filter to remove the waypoints with this command:
