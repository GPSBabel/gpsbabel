       This filter modifies any tracks so that either the distance or the time
       between consecutive points is no less than the specified interval. Where
       points are missing, the filter fills them in by following a straight 
       line (actually a great circle) between the adjacent points.  You
       must specify either the "distance" or the "time" option.
