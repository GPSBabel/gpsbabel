         a hdop and/or vdop over a set limit. If you give both the
         hdop and a vdop options, by default points that exceed EITHER
         are discarded (OR). This filter processes waypoints, tracks,
         and routes.

         <para>HDOP (float)</para>
         <para>Points with a hdop exceeding the given value are
         discarded.

         <para>VDOP (float)</para>
         <para>Points with a vdop exceeding the given value are
         discarded.</para>
         <para>HDOPANDVDOP</para>
         <para>Only useful if both hdop and vdop are given. Now
         logical AND is used, i.e. only points exceeding both given
         values are discarded.
