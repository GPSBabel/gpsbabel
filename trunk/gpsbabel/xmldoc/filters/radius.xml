         on their proximity to a central point.  Distances and the
         central point are declared on the command line by passing the
         <option>distance=X.XX</option>,
         <option>lat=X.XX</option>, and
         <option>lon=X.XX</option> options to
         the filter.  Distance options may be expressed in miles
         (<option>distance=3M</option>) or
         kilometers (<option>distance=3K</option>).  The default is
         zero miles.  Additionally, the exclude option may be
         specified to reverse the effect of the filter, so that points
         further from the center are kept and closer points are
         discarded.</para>
