<para>
  Some GPS data formats support only some subset of waypoints, tracks,
  and routes.  The transform filter allows you to convert between these
  types.  For example, it can be used to convert a pile of waypoints (such
  as those from a CSV file) into a track or vice versa.

<para>
  The following example show you how to create a route from a waypoint table.
</para>
  <para><userinput>gpsbabel -i csv -f waypts.txt -x transform,rte=wpt -o gpx -F route.gpx</userinput></para>
<para>
  Only the first letter of option value decides which transformation will be done.
  Depending on the used option it can be only 'W' for waypoints, 'R' for routes or
  'T' for tracks.
