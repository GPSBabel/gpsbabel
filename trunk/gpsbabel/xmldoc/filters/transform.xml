  Not all known and unknown GPS data formats has beed designed on
  one common idea. So we have waypoint-only, route-only, track-only
  and formats containing more than one of them.
</para>
<para>
  To bring such different formats together we've implemented the transform 
  filter.

  The following example show you how to create a route from a waypoint table.
  <screen format="linespecific">gpsbabel -i csv waypts.txt -x transform,rte=wpt -o gpx -F route.gpx</screen>
  Only the first letter of option value decides which transformation will be done.
  Depending on the used option it can be only 'W' for waypoints, 'R' for routes or
  'T' for tracks.
