      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The cache is not at the coordinates above.   These coords will get you to the correct park and within 1/2 mile of the cache.  The cache is within 35 feet of the trail.   It is not handicapped accessible.   It is a nice walk in the woods that is practical for all ages.  There is no space in the container for trading items.   You should bring a writing stick and bug spray is recommended.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">So if the cache isn't at the above coordinates, where is it?  

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Too bad I hid a boot
&lt;li&gt;Too hot to hoot
&lt;li&gt;Never odd or even
&lt;li&gt;Do geese see God?
&lt;li&gt;"Do nine men interpret?" "Nine men," I nod
&lt;li&gt;Rats live on no evil star
&lt;li&gt;Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog
&lt;/ul&gt;

Now that it's intuitively obvious to even the most casual observer where the cache is, turn on your geo-mojo and go find it.
