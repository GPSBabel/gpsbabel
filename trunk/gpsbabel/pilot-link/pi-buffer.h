/** @file pi-buffer.h
 *  @brief Variable size buffer management interface
 *  @author Florent Pillet
 *
 * pi-buffer provides for a reliable and easy to use variable size buffer
 * management, allowing for buffers that grow as needed to store
 * variable-length data.
 *
 * When you create a buffer with pi_buffer_new(), you indicate an initial
 * capacity that is allocated. The number of used bytes is set to 0. To
 * append data to the buffer, use pi_buffer_append(). This ensures that the
 * buffer grows as needed.
 *
 * You can access data in the buffer using the @a buffer->data member. The
 * number of bytes used is always accessible using @a buffer->used.
 *
 * It is possible to use the pi-buffer functions on static buffers. In this
 * case, you won't call pi_buffer_free() on the structure. You'll dispose of
 * the memory yourself instead. Here is an example:
 *
 * @code
 *	pi_buffer_t mybuf;
 *	mybuf.data = (unsigned char *) malloc(256);
 *	mybuf.allocated = 256;
 *	mybuf.used = 0;
 *
 *	// ... perform your tasks here ....
 *	pi_buffer_append(&mybuf, somedata, somedatasize);
 *	// ...
 *
 *	free(mybuf.data);
 * @endcode
