This directory is a tiny subset of the pilot-link 0.12.2 code from
http://www.pilot-link.org. It is licensed under the GPL.

We considered conditionalizing away some of the code we didn't use, but
once we realized the compiled object size was already smaller than the
coldsync code it replaces, that didn't make sense.
