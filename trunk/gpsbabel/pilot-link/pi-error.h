/** @file pi-error.h
 *  @brief Error definitions for the errors returned by libpisock's dlp_XXX functions.
 *
 * Most dlp_XXX functions return a value that is >= if the function
 * succeeded, or < 0 if there was an error. The error code can be directly
 * tested, and can also be retrieved using pi_error(). If the error code is
 * #PI_ERR_DLP_PALMOS, you should read the error code returned by the device
 * using pi_palmos_error().
 *
 * @note These error codes are tailored to not conflict with dlpErr* codes
 * defined in dlp.h, and which can be checked using pi_palmos_error()
 *
