Magxfer uploads detail and base maps to Magellan's mapping GPS receivers
under POSIX operating systems like UnixWare, OpenServer, Linux, FreeBSD,
Solaris, and OpenBSD.  It is most useful on the 330 and SportTrak;
Meridians can just read the maps from the SD cards.

It does **not** create or edit those maps; for that you must still
use Mapsend.  But once you've used Mapsend to create the maps, you
may keep a collection of *.img files on your UNIX system and use this
utility to shoot them into your receiver.  The files you need are in the
"export/images" in whatever location you installed Mapsend.

Usage is simple:

	magxfer [-p portname] [-b bitrate] [-t type ] -f filetosend.img

	portname specifies the serial port to use.  The default 
		is "/dev/ttyS0" which is the first serial port on a 
		Linux PC.

	bitrate specifies the speed to send the upload command.  The
		default is 4800.   After connection is made, the actual
		transfer happens at 115200 bps, regardless of this option.

	type    can be d for detailed map or s for secondary base map such
		as by Worldwide Basemap or p for primary basemap.  Default
	        is d. 

                Additionally, type can be h to specify a firmware
                hex file containing srecords for upload on the unit.
		See disclaimer below.

        filetosend.img is the image file you wish to upload to the unit.

***FIRMWARE UPDATE DISCLAIMER*** 

Firmware upload has been tested on a SporTrak Pro in both normal mode
and in emergency upload mode initiated by pressing NAV+MENU while
turning the Sportrack ON.  It is possible that this doesn't work on all
units.  Failed firmware upgrades may require returning your unit to
Magellan for service which may or may not be covered under warranty.  We
make no promise of any kind that firmware uploads will succeed.  If your
unit croaks, it's your responsibility, not ours.
