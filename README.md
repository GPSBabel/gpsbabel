Current status of the trunk build is [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gpsbabel/gpsbabel.svg?branch=master)]. Passing is good. We like passing. 

The absolute [latest GPSBabel build](https://travis-ci.org/gpsbabel/gpsbabel) may not have made the front page yet. It takes about an hour to run our rigorous [presubmit testing](https://www.gpsbabel.org/quality.html) via [Appveyor for GPSBabel Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gpsbabel/gpsbabel) and [Travis for GPSBabel on Linux](https://travis-ci.org/gpsbabel/gpsbabel/). We are proud of our rating on Codacy: [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/362d2edacb5a4d73a9af023f08525a54)](https://www.codacy.com/app/gpsbabel/gpsbabel?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=gpsbabel/gpsbabel&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

If you aren't a programmer or a writer, we need help with gear, hosting costs, tool license prices, answering questions on the mailing lists, etc. Please [support GPSBabel](https://www.gpsbabel.org/contribute.html) any way you can.

## News
We moved the source here on July 31, 2015 because [Google Code is shutting
down](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html) and
there is a large inertia in the open source world for Git in general and Github specifically.

As a result, some of our doc with our last release will now point to links on
[code.google.com](https://code.google.com) that will no longer work.
If you find doc that is out of date, please let us know.
(Better yet, please send pull requests with fixes.)
