# GPSBabel
This is the source code for [GPSBabel](https://www.gpsbabel.org), the free software project to manage GPS data (waypoints, tracks, routes) in your GPSes or in related programs.

## News
We moved the source here on July 31, 2015 because [Google Code is shutting
down](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html) and
there is a large inertia in the open source world for Git in general and Github specifically.

As a result, some of our doc with our last release will now point to links on
[code.google.com](https://code.google.com) that will no longer work.
If you find doc that is out of date, please let us know.
(Better yet, please send pull requests with fixes.)
