# gpsbabel XCSV style file
#
# Format: Dumps all fields in a traditional Unix tab separated style
#
# The order of the fields (with the exception of LAT_DIR/LON_DIR) was
# the same as documented in README.style when this format was created.
# LAT_DIR/LON_DIR were undocumented, so I stuck them at the end of the
# other lat/lon fields.
#
# However, please add any new gpsbabel fields to the end (to avoid
# upsetting existing applications) regardless of where they land in
# the README.style documentation.
#
