<para xml:id="g-filter-kalman-max_speed">
  This option sets a speed limit for your track. The filter will
  discard any point that would require you to have moved at a speed
  greater than this limit to get there from the previous point.

<para>
  This is a powerful tool for cleaning up "GPS zingers" â€“ those
  moments where your GPS receiver momentarily reports a position far
  away from your actual location and then jumps back. For example, if
  you are recording a walk, you could set this to a reasonable walking
  speed like 3 meters per second. Any point that would imply you
  suddenly moved at 50 m/s will be thrown out.
</para>
<para>
  Example: You are cycling and have a max speed of 15 m/s (54 km/h).
  You could set:
<screen>
gpsbabel -i gpx -f my_ride.gpx -x kalman,max_speed=15 -o gpx -F my_ride_filtered.gpx
</screen>
</para>
<para>
  The units are always in meters per second.
</para>
<para>
  The pre-defined profiles use the following values: 'walking' (2.0), 'running' (10.0), 'cycling' (30.0), 'driving' (50.0), and 'flying' (300.0). If you are using a profile, you do not need to set this option unless you want to override the profile's default.
</para>
<para>
  If you are using a <link linkend="g-filter-kalman-profile">profile</link>,
  this value is set automatically, but you can override it here.
