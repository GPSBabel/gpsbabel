This is most useful if you are trying to obtain the closest points in
a road to some places. Or if you want to know the step times on some
places over the tracks. Also to transform waypoints in Garmin course points
(see <link linkend="fmt_gtrnctr">gtrnctr</link> and
<link linkend="fmt_garmin">garmin</link> format).
