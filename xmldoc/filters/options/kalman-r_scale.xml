<para xml:id="g-filter-kalman-r_scale">
  This option adjusts the filter's sensitivity to the raw GPS
  measurements. It answers the question: "How much should I trust the
  incoming GPS data points?"

  Think of this as a "skepticism" knob. A higher
  <option>r_scale</option> value makes the filter more skeptical of
  each measurement, leading to more aggressive smoothing. This is
  useful if your track is very jittery or noisy, which can happen in
  urban canyons or under heavy tree cover. A lower value tells the
  filter to trust the measurements more, sticking closer to the
  original data.

<para>
  This option is a unitless scaling factor. For technically-minded
  users, this parameter scales the measurement
  noise covariance matrix (R). Increasing it causes the filter to give
  less weight to the measurement and more weight to its own internal
  prediction.

  The value is a floating-point number. There's no strict range, but
  the pre-defined profiles offer a guide. For activities with smooth,
  predictable motion like 'flying', a low value like 0.01 is
  used. For activities with more erratic or slower movement like
  'walking', a high value of 100.0 is used. A value of 1.0 (the
  default for 'cycling') is a common starting point. Experimentation
  is encouraged to find the best value for your specific data.

  this value is set automatically, but you can override it here.
