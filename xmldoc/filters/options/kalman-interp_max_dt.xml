  This is an important safeguard. For example, if you stop your GPS
  for lunch and restart it an hour later, you almost certainly do not
  want the filter to draw a straight line across the map connecting
  the stop and start points. This setting prevents that by defining a
  time limit beyond which interpolation will not be performed.

<para>
  If you want to prevent any interpolation, you can set this value to
  zero.

  The pre-defined profiles use the following values: 'walking' (60s), 'running' (120s), 'cycling' (300s), 'driving' (600s), and 'flying' (3600s). If you are using a profile, you do not need to set this option unless you want to override the profile's default.

  If you are using a <link linkend="g-filter-kalman-profile">profile</link>,
  this value is set automatically, but you can override it here.
