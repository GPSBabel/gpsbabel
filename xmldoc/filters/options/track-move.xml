<para>
This option changes the time of all trackpoints. This might be useful if
your track must be moved by one or more hours because of an incorrect
time zone.
It can also be useful to correct tracks for week number roll over problems.

<para>
The value of this option is a series of integer and unit pairs.  Each integer may include a
leading '+' or '-' sign.  Positive integers shift the tracks later, while negative integers shift
the tracks earlier.  If no sign is provided the integer is assumed to be nonnegative.
Possible units are w for weeks, d for days, h for hours, m for minutes and s for seconds.

<para>
The following command line will shift all tracks to be 1024 weeks later.  Because the GPS Week Number
is transmitted modulo 1024 there is the possibility that the recovered timestamp will be off by
a multiple of 1024 weeks.
