<para>
  This option analyzes a track and automatically creates new track segments when it detects an abnormally large gap between points.

<para>
  This is useful for cleaning up tracks where the GPS signal may have been lost temporarily, causing a large, artificial jump between two points. The filter uses a weighted moving average of the distance between points to determine what constitutes an "abnormal" gap. When such a gap is found, it marks the beginning of a new track segment.

<para>
  This option also performs a "denoising" step, removing series of redundant points that are extremely close together and have similar properties.
