<para>
  This option helps the filter identify significant gaps in your
  track, such as when you lose satellite signal in a tunnel or deep
  valley.

<para>
  The filter calculates the typical time interval between your GPS
  points. If it finds a gap that is this factor larger than the
  typical interval, it enters a "recovery mode." This factor is a
  unitless multiplier. In this mode, it is
  more cautious and re-evaluates its estimates more carefully once new
  data arrives.
</para>
<para>
  For example, if the median time interval between your GPS points is 2
  seconds, and <option>gap_factor</option> is 5, the filter will
  consider a gap of more than 10 seconds (5 * 2s) to be
  significant. The default value is 5.0. A lower value like 2.0 would
  make the filter more sensitive to gaps, while a higher value like
  10.0 would make it less sensitive.
</para>
<para>
  Most users will not need to adjust this setting. It is designed to
  help the filter behave more robustly when faced with real-world
  signal interruptions.
