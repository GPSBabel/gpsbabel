The resampling filter can be used to change the sample rate of a track.  It is intended to be used with track points that have been sampled at a constant rate. It can be used to change the sample rate by a rational factor.  It can also be used to smooth a track with or without changing the sample rate.  The filter works across the antimeridian.

<title>Interpolation with the resampling filter</title>
<para>
This examples doubles the sample rate.  The data is filtered after interpolation regardless of the order of the options.

<title>Decimation with the resampling filter</title>
<para>
This examples reduces the sample rate by a factor of two.  The data is filtered before decimation regardless of the order of the options.

<title>Averaging with the resampling filter</title>
<para>
This examples averages the adjacent points.  A running average filter of length two samples is applied in the forward and reverse directions.
