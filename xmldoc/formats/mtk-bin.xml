<para>Binary file protocol converter for MTK based GPS loggers.
This format reads the raw binary format created by the MTK Windows application
and outputs to other formats  supported by GPSBabel
When using the csv option a MTK application compatible output file will also be created.</para>
<para>
It has been tested with <trademark>Transystem i-Blue 747</trademark> but other devices should
work as well (Qstarz BT-Q1000, iTrek Z1, ...)
</para><para>
All position items (including button push) will be listed as trackpoints in the output.
Log items due to button push are presented as waypoints.
In theory we would not add waypoints to the list of trackpoints. But as the MTK logger restart the
log session from the button press we would loose a trackpoint unless we include/duplicate it.
