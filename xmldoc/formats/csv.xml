      
      <para> There are a billion variants of Comma Separated Value
data.  This is the one specifically that makes <ulink url="http://www.delorme.com">Delorme</ulink> <productname>S&amp;A Deluxe 9</productname> happy. It's
also a very simple program and useful for many other programs like
spreadsheets, but contains only a very minimal information. For general
purpose use, you'll probably be more happy with our 
<link linkend="fmt_unicsv">universal csv (unicsv)</link> format.</para>
      <para> CSV is also the correct format for 
	<productname>Lowrance MapCreate</productname>,
their commercial mapping program, or GDM6 (their free waypoint
manager) for iFinder which is available at <ulink url="http://www.lowrance.com/Software/GDM6/Default.asp">lowrance.com</ulink>
         </para>
    <para>
	On write, this format writes simple "latitude, longitude" pairs, but 
on read it  will read anything supported by our <link linkend="style_def_lathuman">human readable</link> definition.
    </para>
    <para>
       For something-separated data that has headers identifying the various
	fields, see our <link linkend="fmt_unicsv">universal csv</link> format.
