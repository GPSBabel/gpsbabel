<link linkend="fmt_xmap">XMap</link> 
, except there are 
	no spaces between fields and the coordinate format is slightly 
	different. The completely pointless header and footer lines 
	are the same, at least. Use this to create the XMapHHWptsSend.txt 
	file needed to sync to Street Atlas Handheld 2006.</para>
	<para>Note that in order to keep from creating duplicates on your handheld, you must first remove the file "XMapWptsDB" from your handheld, restart SAHH2006 on the handheld to create an empty database, and THEN sync the new file. </para>
