compact flash cards.  File formats were provided by Holux-Taiwan
<ulink url="http://www.holux.com.tw">holux.com</ulink> to the author.
The code was tested against version 2.27E1; other versions and
receivers may work but have not been explicitly tested.  Anyone with
information on other Holux receivers is encouraged to contact
jochen@bauerbahn.net.

      <para> When copying the .wpo file to a flash card, the file must
be named <filename moreinfo="none">tempwprt.wpo</filename> as the
receiver will ignore all other files.
</para>
      <para> Comparing the waypoints of a .wpo files against other
formats like .gpx you may notice a small difference in the latitude
and longitude values.  The reason is the low resolution of the
coordinates in the wpo file format.  In a .wpo file the resolution is
1/10"; in gpx for example it is 1/100".  A a practical matter, this
loss is only about 1.7 meters (5 feet).
</para>
      <para> The generated waypoint files can also be used by MapShow
version 1.14.  This program is free of charge from the Holux web site.
