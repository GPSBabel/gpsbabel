<para> 
	Tab separated export-all (except geocaching data) file
	format.  Intended to serve as source for number-processing
	applications like OpenOffice, Ploticus and others. Tab was chosen as
	delimiter because it is a) supported by both OpenOffice and Ploticus
	and b) is not ',', so you can use <userinput moreinfo="none">sed -i
	"s/./,/g" &lt;x&gt;.csv'</userinput> to adapt it to locales where ',' is
	used as decimal separator.  Contributed by Tobias Minich.
