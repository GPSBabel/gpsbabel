      <para> For geocachers importing data from a tool like GSAK or
Spinner, import the file twice in XData.  One will create a file with
the Cache description as a hyperlink on the flag. This can clutter up
the screen and when you try to zoom in, it causes problems.  So the
second one will only have a flag. Thus you can turn off and on which
one you want to view.  The first time you import the file, in the
assign field types, check the circle above Full Name and then next.
The second time you import the file do not check any circle and in the
second to last column, change URL to none and then click next. Use the
same name you used the first time but add -Flag to it.
