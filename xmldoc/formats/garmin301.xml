<para>
  This is a very simple format that
is most useful for exporting data from units that support heart rate
data such as

  <trademark>Garmin Forerunner 301</trademark>,
  <trademark>Garmin Forerunner 305</trademark>, and
  <trademark>Garmin Edge 305</trademark>, and
to other programs
for analysis.   It's a simple comma delimited format that includes the
timestamp, 3D position information and heart rate so you can pull it
into a spreadsheet or graphing program.
