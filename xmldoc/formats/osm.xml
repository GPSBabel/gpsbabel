  This format is used to exchange data with the <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</link> project.
  The main goal of this collaborative project is to create free editable maps.

  These data files are XML based. Every GPS element (way or node) described by the files has a unique
  number as identifier. When we write OSM data files and don't know something about the id's,
  negative numbers will be used as identifier. This has been tested with <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/JOSM">JOSM</link>.

  Because the resulting timestamps of OSM ways differ from real GPS tracks,
  we read OSM ways into routes. On the output side we write all available routes and tracks into the osm target file.
