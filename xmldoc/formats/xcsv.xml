This format is a very flexible module that can be used to read or write
nearly any plain-text record-based waypoint file.  This flexibility is
achieved by combining this format with "style" files that describe the
format of the waypoint files.

    (Extended CSV) provides powerful, highly customizable CSV import
    and export, requiring the definition of a "style file". It is
    intended for advanced users working with unique or complex CSV
    structures that cannot be handled by other formats.

    If your CSV file has a header row and a standard structure, the
    <link linkend="fmt_unicsv">Universal CSV (<code>unicsv</code>)</link>
    format is typically easier to use and recommended. For an overview
    of all CSV formats and guidance on which to choose, refer to the

<para>
There are several formats built in to GPSBabel that use the underlying xcsv
machinery.  Each of those formats takes the same options as the xcsv format,
with the obvious exception of the <option>style</option> option.
Those formats are all based on style files that can be found in
the "style" directory in the GPSBabel source distribution.
