<para>
gps-week-rollover is used to override the best-guessing of GPS week rollover period
we're currently in: skytraq log data contains dates in the form of GPS weeks,
which roll over to 0 every 1024 weeks (close to 20 years).

<para>
The default behaviour when gps-week-rollover isn't given (or is a negative number)
is to assume the input data has been logged within the preceding 1024 weeks from the
time gpsbabel is run, which should be perfectly fine in almost all cases.
</para>

<para>
The following example:
<screen>
<command>gpsbabel</command> -i skytraq.bin,gps-week-rollover=1 -f <replaceable>filename.bin</replaceable>
</screen>

indicates that logged data is assumed to be from the period between 21/22 Aug 1999 and 6/7 April 2019.
