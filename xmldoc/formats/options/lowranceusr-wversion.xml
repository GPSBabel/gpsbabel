<para>
  While GPSBabel is capable of supporting all five USR formats for input processing
  it is currently only able to generate USR format 2, 3, or 4 due to the lack of
  detailed information on some of the data contained in the other formats.
</para>
 
<para>
  By default, GPSBabel will generate USR version 2 data if the output format is
  specified as <emphasis>lowranceusr</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
<userinput>
 gpsbabel ... -o lowranceusr,wversion=2 -F blah.usr
</userinput>
is exactly the same as
<userinput>
 gpsbabel ... -o lowranceusr -F blah.usr
</userinput>
</para>

<para>
  Newer (post 2006 or so) Lowrance devices added a version three of their
  USR file format that adds waypoint depth.  Lowrance recommends that this USR version
  be used when transferring user data to systems such as
  LMS, LCX, and so on.   Specify "3" to output USR version 3 data
  on write.  
</para>

<para>
To create a USR version 3 file that contains waypoint depth information use these output options:
<userinput>
 gpsbabel ... -o lowranceusr,wversion=3 -F blah.usr
</userinput>
</para>
