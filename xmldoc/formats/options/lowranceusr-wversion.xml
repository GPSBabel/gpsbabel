<para>
  Newer (post 2006 or so) Lowrance devices added a version three of their
  USR file format that adds depth.  Lowrance recommends that this USR version
  be used when transferring user data to older systems such as
  LMS, LCX, and so on.   Specify "3" to output USR version 3 data
  on write.

</para>


<para>
To create a file that contains depth but therefore isn't usable
on older Lowrance products, use this:
<userinput>
 gpsbabel ... -o lowranceusr,wversion=3 -F blah.usr
</userinput>
</para>
