<para>
In the default mode the reader will issue a fatal error if it encounters indications of a corrupt file. These indications include:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>a bad Header or File CRC</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>a bad endian field</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>an attempt to read when the data section doesn't have sufficient data</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>an attempt to read past the end of file</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
In recovery mode when we encounter one of these errors we will abort
read processing and continue. This allows any writer to use data that
was recovered previous to the read abort.
