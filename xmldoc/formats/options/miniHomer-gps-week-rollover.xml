<para>
  This option allows you to manually specify the GPS week rollover period for the track data.

<para>
  The GPS system broadcasts time as a week number and the number of seconds into that week. The week number is a 10-bit value, which means it resets to zero every 1024 weeks (approximately every 19.6 years). This event is known as a "week number rollover".
</para>
<para>
  If this option is not specified, or is set to -1, GPSBabel will use its "best guess" to determine the correct 1024-week epoch, assuming the data was recorded in the most recent period. This is almost always correct for modern data.

<para>
  You should only need to use this option if you are working with very old data that crosses a rollover boundary. The epochs are:
