<para>
Sets baud rate on some Garmin serial unit to the specified baud rate. Garmin protocol uses 9600 bps by default, but there is a rarely documented feature in Garmin binary protocol for switching baud rate. The maximum value is 115200.

Download track log and waypoints 12 times faster than default:
<userinput>
gpsbabel -t -w -i garmin,baud=115200 -f /dev/ttyUSB0 -o gpx -F garmin-serial.gpx
</userinput>
</para>

<para>
At the end of the transfer the baud rate is switched to back to the default
of 9600. If the connection breaks and the unit is stuck at a high baud rate power
cycling should restore the original baud rate.

<para>
This option does not affect USB transfer.

Because this feature uses undocumented Garmin protocols, it may or may
not work on your device.  The author reported success with
eTrex Vista, GPSMAP 76s, and GPS V, but it seems likely to be problematic
on older units and may be more problematic for writing to the device than
reading data from the device.
