<para>
  This option controls the size of the data blocks, in kilobytes, requested from an MTK-based device (including the Holux M-241) during a data download.

<para>
  The value must be an integer between 1 and 64. The default value is 1 KB.

  In general, a larger block size can result in a faster download. However, on some less reliable serial or USB connections, a smaller block size may be more stable. If you experience timeouts or errors during download, you may want to try a smaller value.
