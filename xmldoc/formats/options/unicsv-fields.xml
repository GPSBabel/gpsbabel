<para>
This option lets you specify the field names of your input file from
the command line instead of relying on the first line of your input
file describing the file. Field names are separated by a '+' character.
The list of field names is exactly that allowed in the first line of a
unicsv file without this option.
</para>  

<example id="unicsv_fields">
  <title>Example for unicsv fields option to describe input file.</title>
  <para>
    For example ...
    <userinput>
      gpsbabel -i unicsv,fields=lat+lon+description -f file.csv -o gpx -F file.gpx
    </userinput>
    declares that file.csv has three fields, latitude, longitude, 
    and description, in that order.
