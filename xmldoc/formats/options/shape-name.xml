This option specifies where to get name information for each shape. Without this option the name data will be fetched from a field named "NAME" if it exists in the .dbf file.

It the value is a set of digits then the name is fetched from a record with that field index in the .dbf file.
Otherwise, if the value does not start with a '+' character, the name is fetched from record with that field name in the .dbf file.
When the value starts with a '+' character then multiple records from the .dbf file can be combined to create the name.
The plus character should be followed by a set of digit(s) representing a field index, or a field name as above.
This may be followed by an additional '+' character, and another set of digits or a field name.
As many records as desired can be selected in this fashion.
For example shape,name=+0+4 would create a name by combining records with field indices 0 and 4.
shape,name=+osm_id+name would create a name by combining records with field names 'osm_id' and 'name'.
