<para>
  This option controls whether to include the True Airspeed (TAS) data from the IGC file.
</para>
<para>
  This is a boolean option that is enabled by default. True airspeed is the speed of the aircraft relative to the airmass in which it is flying. It is a critical piece of data for flight analysis and performance calculations. While the IGC specification suggests the units should be defined in the file, this is rarely done; GPSBabel assumes the value is in kilometers per hour (km/h).

  To exclude this data, use <userinput>TAS=0</userinput>.
