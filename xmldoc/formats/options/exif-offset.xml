<para>
   Uses the given value instead of the value from the tag OffsetTime, OffsetTimeOriginal or OffsetTimeDigitized.
   This is useful when the image doesn't contain an OffsetTime* tag and the offset is different from the local time, or when the image contains a tag that is incorrect.
   The format of this option should match that of the tag OffsetTime*, specifcally it must be "+HH:MM" or "-HH:MM".

<para>
    If the camera was using China Standard Time, e.g. in the winter in Taiwan, then you should supply
    an offset of "+8:00".
