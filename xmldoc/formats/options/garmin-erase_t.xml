By default, when writing courses to the device,
GPSBabel tries to keep any courses that already exist on the device.
To do this, all the courses on the device must be downloaded,
merged with the new courses, and then sent to the device.
This option allows for any preexisting courses on the device to be overwritten.
If you don't want to preserve preexisting courses,
this option is recommended because it allows a faster transfer.

This option applies only to Garmin devices that support courses such as the Edge 305 or the Forerunner 305.
