  This is a boolean flag, defaulting to '0', that controls whether GPSBabel
  writes the &lt;Track&gt; tag that Google introduced in Earth 5.2 for tracks. You
    may need to turn this off if you have a KML reader that's confused by new
    tags or if size is critical.

<para>
  Routes and tracks without sufficient time data are always drawn as
  Linestrings and never Tracks.
