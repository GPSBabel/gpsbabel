gps-utc-offset is used to override the built-in table of offsets of
the offset between GPS time and UTC time. This chipset reports only
GPS time to the host and relies on software to know every time an adjustment
is made. Since GPS time offsets can change without a new version of GPSBabel
is released, those that care about total accuracy can override it.
