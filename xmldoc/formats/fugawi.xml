binary format used by <ulink url="http://www.fugawi.com">Fugawi</ulink>. Like any other CSV format, GPSBabel
cannot read tracks in this format, but converting a track into it and
then importing as track in Fugawi works.</para>
      <para> It is known to work with Fugawi V3.1.4.635. When
importing/exporting waypoints, one has to specify the order of fields
as follows (names of fields may depend on the language used by
Fugawi):</para>
      <simplelist type="vert">
	<member> - Name</member>
	<member> - Comment</member>
	<member> - Description</member>
	<member> - Latidude</member>
	<member> - Longitude</member>
	<member> - Altitude (meters)</member>
	<member> - Date (yyyymmdd/yymmdd)</member>
	<member> - Time of day (hhmmss)</member>
      </simplelist>
      <para> When importing tracks, use "[ignore]" instead of "Name",
"Comment" and "Description".</para>
