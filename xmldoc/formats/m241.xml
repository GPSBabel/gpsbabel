	The Holux m241 is a small datalogger using the MTK chipset, with
	a couple small differences in the binary format. In its default
	configuration, it can store ~100000 trackpoints with very limited
	 data; to configure extended logging you can use the BT747 open
	source software

	 Waypoint storage is possible only if "recording reason" (RCR) is enabled in the settings.

  The m-241 came in two models. The yellow one, popular with photographers,
  internally used the Silicon Labs CP210X chipset to transform the internal and
  inaccessible serial port to the USB port that was familiar on the side. The
  drivers for that port can be found with

  very briefly before Holux went out of business. GPSBabel does not work with
  the red and white one.

	Holux GPSport 245 is a datalogger with display suitable for cycling, walking and running.
        It can store ~200k trackpoints with limited data. The m241 and m241-bin format is
        able to automatically detect GPSport 245 data and handle the differences from Holux 241 devices.
        Note: GP245 does not log any quality of the position.

	Use the m241 format to connect with the unit serially and m241-bin to read files saved by the device.

  This module is also reported to handle the Holux M1000c.

  Most of the loggers cannot receive bluetooth commands, they can only send
  data. Since GPSBabel needs to send commands to the GPS device it won't
  work. Download the data using the USB cable instead.
