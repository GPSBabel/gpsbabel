GPSBabel supports reading and writing of tracks in the .fit
format used by products based on the Garmin

<para>
As in case of <link linkend="fmt_gtrnctr">Garmin Training Center</link>,
FIT files contain courses with laps etc. which don't exactly match
GPSBabel's waypoints, tracks, and routes. An attempt is made to extract and
transform data than can be handled by GPSBabel like heart rate etc. and
conversion from waypoints to course points and vice versa. Note that routes
are not handled, so they should be transformed to tracks first before
converting to FIT. Also, track segments are not supported, so all segments
in a track get concatenated and written as a single continuous track without
gaps.

<para>
When writing a FIT file, waypoints are converted to course points by
inserting them at the nearest location in the track/course. By default,
generic course points are written unless the waypoint name contains one of
the following words in which case course points of type left/right are
emitted:
<simplelist type="vert">
<member>left, links, gauche, izquierda, sinistra</member>
<member>right, rechts, droit, derecha, destro</member>
</simplelist>
</para>
<para>
FIT courses typically contain speed information. If the original track
contains neither speed information nor timestamps which may be used to
derive the speed, a speed of 10 km/h is assumed and assigned to the course.
