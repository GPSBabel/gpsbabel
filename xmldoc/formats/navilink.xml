	This format is used for both the serial protocol used on
	the USB link and for the files which can be copied from the
	internal memory to the SD card using recent firmware versions.

<para>
	If you specify a serial port for the file (.e.g. "COM1", "/dev/ttyUSB0")
	to be read or written, GPSBabel will use the serial protocol. Specifying
	a file, either on local filesystem or on a mounted flash card reader,
	will results in the file-based format being used.

	To access the device using the serial protocol over USB the
	device needs to be in Navilink mode, which can be activated
	from the main menu of the device. This device uses a Prolific 
	PL2303 USB/Serial adapter internally and that's how it will 
	present itself to the host operating system. You thus need
	USB drivers for the PL2303, such as those from the 'Download'
	section of
