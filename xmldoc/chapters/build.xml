  <para> 
GPSBabel is distributed "ready to run" on most common 
operating systems via the 
<ulink url="http://www.gpsbabel.org/download.html">download page</ulink>.
</para>
  <para> As GPSBabel runs on a wide variety of operating systems,
be sure to visit the 
<ulink url="http://www.gpsbabel.org/osnotes.html">OS-Specific notes</ulink> for
additional information.

<title>Building from source.</title>
  <para> 
 For operating systems where no binary is provided or if 
you want the latest development version, you will have to build it from
source.  The code should be compilable on any system with
ISO C++. It's tested on Linux, Mac OS/X, and Windows cross compilers.
Less frequently, someone will build on MSVC, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, 
etc.   Both Clang/LLVM and GNU C++ are regularly exercised.
</para>
<para>
You can grab a release from the <ulink url="http://www.gpsbabel.org/download.html">GPSBabel download page</ulink>, but if you're going to be doing any development, you'll find that working from the <ulink url="https://github.com/gpsbabel/gpsbabel">GPSBabel Github repo</ulink> is easier. Checkouts vis Git, HTTPS, SSH, and Subversion are supported.
</para>

<para>
  In most cases, the code is as simple to build as running:
</para>
<para><userinput> ./configure &amp;&amp; make</userinput></para>
  <para><ulink url="http://qt-project.org">Qt</ulink> 
is required for all builds.  Mac and Windows users can download
binaries from <ulink url="http://qt-project.org/downloads">Qt Downloads</ulink>
Fedora or CentOS users may need to 'yum install qt-devel'.  Optionally, use qt5-base.  When in doubt, 'yum search qt' or 'yum search qt5' can help you find the correct package name
Ubuntu users may need to 'apt-get install qtbase5-dev'.
Qt versions 5.2 and newer are supported.
</para>
  <para><ulink url="http://libusb.sourceforge.net">libusb</ulink> 
is recommended for OS/X and Linux if you want to use a USB Garmin or 
DeLorme device.
Fedora users may need to 'yum install libusb-devel'.  Ubuntu users may
need to 'yum install libusb-dev'.
</para>
<para>There are additional flags that can be passed to configure to
 customize your build of GPSBabel.   
</para>
<para><userinput>./configure --help</userinput></para> 
<para>
lists all the supported options, but of interest we have:</para><para>
 <option>--disable-shapefile</option> Excludes the shapefile support.
</para>
<para>
  <option>--disable-csv</option> Excludes all support for our something-separated formats.
</para>
<para>
  <option>--disable-filters</option> Excludes all filter support.
</para>
<para>
  <option>--enable-efence</option> Activate debugging mode for gpsbabel-debug.
</para>
<para>
  <option>--with-doc=</option><filename class="directory">dir</filename> Specifies that the doc should be created and installed in <filename class="directory">dir</filename>.
</para>
<para>
  <option>--without-libusb</option> Disables use of libusb, even it's it's available.
</para>
<para>
 <option>--with-zlib=(included)|system|no</option> By default, we use our own version of zlib. If you specify <option>system</option> the system zlib is used.  A value of <option>no</option> (or --without-zlib) disables zlib.
