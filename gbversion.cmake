# Use GB variable to express ownership intention and avoid conflict with

# Including this pri file from ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR} will generate the version
# file in the current build directory, i.e. ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}.

# Note some of these variables are also used in the gui to generate setup.iss.
# Note some of these variables are also used in the cli to generate documents.

# FIXME: when we have a hierarchical build we can set the version directly
# in the top level CMakeLists.txt file, and the version components will
# be automatically available in as variables.  But today we have multiple
# independent CMakeLists.txt files all with their own project commands.
# By defining the version here we minimize the number of locations
# containing the definition to gbversion.pri and gbversion.cmake.
