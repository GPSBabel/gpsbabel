/* The following comments are from an email I wrote to Paul Fox in November
 * 2005 in an attempt to explain how the cross track error minimization method
 * works  (RLP 2005):
 *
 * It's pretty simple, really: for each triplet of vertices A-B-C, we compute
 * how much cross-track error we'd introduce by going straight from A to C
 * (the maximum cross-track error for that segment is the height of the
 * triangle ABC, measured between vertex B and edge AC.)  If we need to remove
 * 40 points, we just sort the points by that metric and remove the 40
 * smallest ones.
 *
 * It's actually a little more complicated than that, because removing a
 * point changes the result for its two nearest neighbors.  When we remove
 * one, we recompute the neighbors and then sort them back into the list
 * at their new locations.
 *
 * As you can see, this hasn't been shown to be an optimal algorithm.  After
 * all, removing one high-xte point might create two very low-xte neighbors
 * that more than make up for the high xte of the original point.  I believe
 * the optimal algorithm would be NP-complete, but I haven't proven it.  This
 * is really more of a heuristic than anything, but it seems to work well for
 * the routes I've fed it.
 *
 * Not in that email was an explanation of how the pathlength-based calculation
 * works: instead of computing the height of the triangle, we just compute
 * the difference in pathlength from taking the direct route.  This case,
 * too, is only a heuristic, as it's possible that a different combination or
 * order of point removals could lead to a smaller number of points with less
 * reduction in path length.  In the case of pathlength, error is cumulative.
